    James Gosling received a BSc in Computer Science
    from the <a href=http://www.cpsc.ucalgary.ca>University of Calgary</a>, Canada in 1977.
    He received a
    <a href=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~alumni/advisor.html>PhD</a>
    in Computer Science from
    <a href=http://www.cs.cmu.edu>Carnegie-Mellon University</a> in 1983.  The title of
    his thesis was "<a href=http://reports-archive.adm.cs.cmu.edu/anon/scan/CMU-CS-83-132.pdf>The Algebraic Manipulation of
    Constraints</a>".  He has built
    satellite data acquisition systems, a
    multiprocessor version of Unix, several compilers,
    mail systems and window managers.  He has also
    built a WYSIWYG text editor, a constraint based
    drawing editor and a text editor called `Emacs'
    for Unix systems.
    He spent many years as a VP & Fellow
    at <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_microsystems>Sun Microsystems</a>.
    At Sun his early activity was
    as lead engineer of the NeWS window system.
    He did the original design of the
    <a href=http://java.sun.com>Java</a> programming
    language and implemented its original compiler
    and virtual machine.  He has been a
    contributor to the
    <i>Real-Time Specification for Java</i>,
    and a researcher at
    <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems_Laboratories>Sun labs</a> where his primary interest was software
    development tools.
	He then was the Chief Technology Officer of Sun's Developer Products
	Group and the CTO of Sun's Client Software Group.
	He briefly worked for Oracle after the acquisition of Sun in 2010.
	After a brief stint at Google, he became the
	chief software architect at <a href=http://liquidr.com>Liquid Robotics</a>
	where he spent his time writing software for the Waveglider,
	an autonomous ocean-going robot.
	In May of 2017 he became a Distinguished Engineer at
	 <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/>Amazon Web Services</a>.
