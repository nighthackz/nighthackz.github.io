It came out pretty well, although it's\nalways embarrassing when folks do direct interview transcripts and\nyou realize how often you use phrases like \"sort of\". Oh well.\n\n<p>In the article there's a comment from me about \"biodiversity\"\nthat's kinda hanging there. They left out a rant I got into about\nthe Irish Potato Famine. To understand what I was trying to get at,\nthere's a really good book you should read <a href=\n\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375760393/ref=nosim/jamesgoslingA\"\n shape=\"rect\"><i>The Botany of Desire: A Plant's-Eye View of the\nWorld</i></a>, by Michael Pollan. When you read it, try to\nre-interpret his comments in terms of economics and engineering.\nVery thought provoking.</p>\n\n",
