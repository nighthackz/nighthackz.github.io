<td valign=top class=content><div class=entry><h1>Mud slinging and diamond cutting (back to being an engineer)</h1>
I've had conversations with several folks in the last couple of
days about the craft of software engineering. There are all sorts
of ways to slice it up, but one that I find useful in some
situations is to divide programming tasks rather crudely into two
categories: mud slinging and diamond cutting.

<p>Mud slinging is where what to do is pretty clear. You just wade
in and start shoveling. You don't have to think to hard and you get
to feel real productive because lots of motion is happening. I
often feel like most of what I do is in this category. It's not too
hard, it needs to get done, Just Do It. I find that it has a
personally satisfying rhythm. Relaxing, low stress, regular
progress. Lots of lines of code cranked out.</p>

<p>Then there's diamond cutting. This is where you stare and stare
at a problem, and then whack! it breaks open. Not much coding gets
done. I find it really frustrating. Why can't I figure it out? Why?
What? How? Sorting socks would be more fun. High stress. But then,
it hits me. A dozen quick lines of code and poof, hard problem
solved. It's a real rush. High dynamic range in emotional
state.</p>

<p>Of course, it's impossible to tell the difference between true
diamond cutting and generic cluelessness.</p>
