  "body" : "I've had conversations with several folks in the last couple of\ndays about the craft of software engineering. There are all sorts\nof ways to slice it up, but one that I find useful in some\nsituations is to divide programming tasks rather crudely into two\ncategories: mud slinging and diamond cutting.\n\n<p>Mud slinging is where what to do is pretty clear. You just wade\nin and start shoveling. You don't have to think to hard and you get\nto feel real productive because lots of motion is happening. I\noften feel like most of what I do is in this category. It's not too\nhard, it needs to get done, Just Do It. I find that it has a\npersonally satisfying rhythm. Relaxing, low stress, regular\nprogress. Lots of lines of code cranked out.</p>\n\n<p>Then there's diamond cutting. This is where you stare and stare\nat a problem, and then whack! it breaks open. Not much coding gets\ndone. I find it really frustrating. Why can't I figure it out? Why?\nWhat? How? Sorting socks would be more fun. High stress. But then,\nit hits me. A dozen quick lines of code and poof, hard problem\nsolved. It's a real rush. High dynamic range in emotional\nstate.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, it's impossible to tell the difference between true\ndiamond cutting and generic cluelessness.</p>\n\n",
