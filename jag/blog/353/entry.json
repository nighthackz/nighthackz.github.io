  "body" : "I love the title of <a href=\n\"http://ianskerrett.wordpress.com/2010/10/22/dear-oracle-get-a-clue/\">Ian\nSkerrett's article</a>. They problem is that in the belief system\nof the Mirror Universe which Oracle inhabits, they <b>do</b> have a\nclue. It's the rest of us unkempt heathens that don't get it.\nOracle can't get a clue until first they admit that they don't have\none. It's like dealing with someone who has a substance abuse\nproblem: Until they admit the need for help, there is usually\nlittle that can be done. Although the <a href=\n\"http://blogs.computerworlduk.com/simon-says/2010/10/parting-words/index.htm\">news\nof the week</a> seems somewhat dark, the best response is to walk\naway from Oracle, stay healthy, and plant a tree elsewhere. \n\n<p>And the LPOD needs to read the <a href=\n\"http://www.cluetrain.com/index.html\">Cluetrain Manifesto</a>.</p>\n\n",
