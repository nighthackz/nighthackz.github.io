If you're attending JavaOne or\nOpenWorld, I'd appreciate it if you'd wear one, just to let Larry\nknow that you care. Or if you just happen to be wandering the\nneighborhood (I know that there are lots of Java hackers who work\nwithin just a few blocks of Moscone). Or if you will be spending\nquality time with an Oracle salesperson. Or in any other situation\nwhere the spirit moves you. It's a gentle but clear way to express\nyour feelings (well.... the last design on the page isn't all that\ngentle - but it's more fun). \n\n<p>Enjoy!!</p>\n\n",
