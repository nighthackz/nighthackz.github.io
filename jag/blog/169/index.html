<td valign=top class=content><div class=entry><h1>Scripting flamewar</h1>
I made some comments recently about scripting languages that
generated flame storms in a variety of places. For example, <a
href="http://jdj.com">JDJ</a> and <a href=
"http://www.artima.com/forums/flat.jsp?forum=270&amp;thread=151886">Artima</a>.
Yes, I did say those things. But there's a lot of context missing,
and they're the flippant soundbite version of what should have been
a long and careful explanation that could easily mushroom into a
series of PhD theses. Amongst all the flamage there are all kinds
of generalizations about "scripting languages" versus "compiled
languages". My big problem with a lot of it is simply that these
two polarizing categories are a pretty poor way of capturing the
distinctions between language designs. The terms are almost as
goofy as "Republican" versus "Democrat". Taking huge
multi-dimensional spaces of choices on different issues, then
combining and simplifying them all down to a brutally simple binary
choice is goofy. 

<p>Over the years I've built quite a lot of scripting systems. I've
also built a number of compilers for non-scripting languages. Given
enough beer I'll even admit to having implemented a Cobol compiler
for money in the deep dark past. But I've done more scripting
systems than non-scripting systems.</p>

<p>There are issues in the tradeoffs between the two linguistic
spaces all over the place. Someday I'd like to write a long tour
through them, but there just aren't enough hours in a day. I have a
hard time getting enough time to do even trivial blogging: being
truly thoughtful takes a lot of time. But I'll try to cover a
few.... For now, I'll make the generalization that "scripting
language" means one that is interpreted with dynamic runtime
typing, and the other camp is languages that are compiled to
machine code and have static runtime typing. This is a broad
over-simplifying generalization, but it matches pretty well what
goes on in common conversations.</p>

<p><b>Raw execution performance:</b> One of the usual arguments for
scripting languages having acceptable performance is that the
overhead of interpretation and dynamic typing doesn't matter. The
performance of the system is dominated by other factors: typically
IO and the language primitives. For example, PERL apps usually
spend the majority of their time in file IO and string primitives.
I've strongly made this argument in the past, and it's quite valid.
But having observed developers usage patterns, the two most common
things that happen to erode the argument are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Developers start doing things that are outside of what the
  language primitives are good at. For example, PostScript has
  great primitives for rendering. So long as you're doing
  rendering, it flies like the wind. But then someone goes and
  writes a game that's heavily based on rendering, and a piece of
  it needs to do collision detection between missiles and targets.
  Physics in PostScript: a bad idea.</li>

  <li>Developers start clamoring for new primitives. Some are too
  specialized to be reasonable "I want a fast collision engine",
  some are rational "object oriented programming has become the
  dominant style in PostScript, but the OO model is implemented in
  PostScript as a library and is slow".</li>
</ol>There are a bunch of ways to respond: 

<ol>
  <li>"Buzz off". My personal favorite. Don't use a hammer to
  tighten a bolt.</li>

  <li>Start adding more primitives. This is hopeless: you drown in
  wave after wave of requests.</li>

  <li>Put in a facility for developers to write their own
  primitives. eg. link hunks of C code into the interpreter. Can
  work pretty well, but the linguistic universe schism can be
  problematic. Not only do developers then need to learn two
  environments, but because of the cross-language calls each
  language can impose difficulties on the other (eg. doing a
  language with a good garbage collector has a hard time
  interacting well with C's malloc/free regime.</li>

  <li>Make the "scripting language" fast enough to implement
  primitives. It tends to end up not looking much like a scripting
  language. This is roughly the road I went down with Java: to see
  how close to a scripting experience I could get while being able
  compile obvious statements like "a=b+c" into one instruction in
  the common case. I could have gone down the road of making
  declarations optional, but I intentionally didn't.</li>
</ol><b>Worrying about scale, evolution and testing:</b> strong
compile-time types dramatically improve the ability of the tools
(compiler, IDE, ...) to do global checking and manipulation. Some
people like this. Some don't. There's a fair amount of evidence
that these sorts of facilities are really helpful in dealing with
systems that get large, evolve over a long time or require large
teams. The most-often-cited reason for preferring dynamic typing is
that it can make the development process easier: no need to bother
typing all those yucky declarations. 

<p>There are a variety of middle-ground solutions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>One is to allow, but not require, declarations. This is
  particularly common in Lisp dialects where you can sprinkle
  declarations like <tt>(fixnum i j k)</tt> where needed to cause
  the code generators to generate efficient code. The big problem
  is figuring out the "where needed" bit. Sometimes it can be dicey
  to figure out all the places where there are issues. Often there
  are no real performance hotspots: no loops burning up all the
  time. Rather, it's a "peanut butter" problem where it's spread
  everywhere: you have to tune <i>everything</i> to make a
  difference.</li>

  <li>
    Another is to make the language be strongly/statically typed,
    but to make the declaration process more transparent. One
    extreme point in this space is <b>ML</b> which does extensive
    type inferencing (leading sometimes to developer confusion
    because they can't figure out what the type inferencing engine
    is doing). An operator that I've long wanted to add to Java is
    "declare and assign": 

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td valign="top" nowrap>v:=e</td>

        <td>Declares v to have the same type as e, and assigns e to
        v. "x:=r*sin(t);" would be roughly equivalent to "double x
        = r*sin(t)".</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td valign="top" nowrap>v:==e</td>

        <td>Just like :=, except that it makes v final</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>There's a lot more to say, but this is enough for
    today...</p>
  </li>
