<div class=entry><h1>URLs are your friend</h1>
It's amazing how cool URLs are, especially when you think of them
as more than just web references. If you use them instead of Files,
you can end up with applications that are much more flexible. I've
gotten to the point where I hardly use class File at all - I almost
always use URLs. They can be really cool when you start exploiting
synergies with other APIs.

<p>For example, drag-and-drop. This seems like an odd one to relate
to URLs, but it does. Drag-and-drop can be somewhat erratic from
one system to another. For example, on some systems when you drag
from a file browser, you never see a file dropped on you, you just
see a string that contains the name of the file. The same thing can
happen with a web browser: dragging an image or a link sometimes
drops a string, or a file. This isn't odd behavior in the D&amp;D
handling in the Java libraries, it's in the originating
application. These days, when I write code that deals with strings
being dropped on me, I will often try to interpret them as other
types. For example, if new File(s).exists() is true, I convert the
file to a URL with new File(s).toURL(). If it doesn't look like a
file, then I try new URL(s).openStream(). If this succeeds, then I
use that URL as the data source. In either case, the data source
looks like a URL. This way I can drag from either a file browser or
a web browser and it all works uniformly.</p>

<p>Another thing to try is to use URLClassLoader as a general
repository manager, not as a class loader. Say you're doing
something like a document editor or a presentation tool. The
document often has associated resources, like images. If you
reference the images using URLs, then they can reside anywhere: on
the local file system, across the net, or packaged inside a zip
file - that's where URLClassLoader comes it. A Jar file is just a
zipped archive of a bunch of files. Applying getResource to a
URLClassLoader attached to a zip file returns a URL that, when
opened, get's you to the file bundled as a component of the zip
file. So you represent a document as a zip file that contains the
document data itself, and all the associated external data objects
(like image files) that you want to bundle with it.</p>
