  "body" : "A couple of days ago we had a long review session for potential\nJavaOne demos. It's really hard because they're (almost) all pretty\ncool, but there's only so much time to show them. The thing that\nstruck me about the process was that there was very little\n\"enterprise software\" in the mix: it was there, but in the\nbackground. It's become like Oxygen in the air we breath: People\ndepend on it, and it's everywhere, but it's not what they think\nabout all day. The stuff that folks were getting excited about was\npretty much all gizmos. From cell phone stuff to factory\nautomation. All networked and connected to the back end.\n\n<p>It's been fabulous to watch the cell phone wave build and sweep\nthe world. It started in Japan and it's finally reaching the US.\nAnd it isn't all games.</p>\n\n",
