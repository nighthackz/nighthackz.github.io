<div class=entry><h1>CALL FOR PARTICIPATION: JVM LANGUAGE SUMMIT, September 2009</h1>
<img align=right src='2009JVM-summit.jpg'>[cross-posted from the JVM summit mailing list] This is a reminder
for the 2009 JVM Language Summit to be held at Sun's Santa Clara
campus on September 16-18, 2009. Registration is now open for
speaker submissions (presentations and workshops) and general
attendance. More information is available at <a href=
"http://jvmlangsummit.com">http://jvmlangsummit.com</a>. 

<p>The JVM Language Summit is an open technical collaboration among
language designers, compiler writers, tool builders, runtime
engineers, and VM architects. We will share our experiences as
creators of programming languages for the JVM and of the JVM
itself. We also welcome non-JVM developers on similar technologies
to attend or speak on their runtime, VM, or language of choice.</p>

<p>The format this year will be slightly different from last year.
Attendees told us that the most successful interactions came from
small discussion groups rather than prepared lectures, so we've
divided the schedule equally between traditional presentations
(we're limiting most presentations to 30 minutes this year) and
"Workshops". Workshops are informal, facilitated discussion groups
among smaller, self-selected participants, and should enable
"deeper dives" into the subject matter. There will also be
impromptu "lightning talks".</p>

<p>We encourage speakers to submit both a presentation and a
workshop; we will arrange to schedule the presentation before the
workshop, so that the presentation can spark people's interest and
the workshop will allow those who are really interested to go
deeper into the subject area. Workshop facilitators may, but are
not expected to, prepare presentation materials, but they should
come prepared to guide a deep technical discussion. We will be
finalizing the program by August 19.</p>

<p>The Summit is being organized by the JVM Engineering team; no
managers or marketers involved! So bring your slide rules and be
prepared for some seriously geeky discussions.</p>

<p>The registration page is now open at: <a href=

<p>If you have any questions, send inquiries to inquire AT
jvmlangsummit.com.</p>

<p>We hope to see you in September!</p>
