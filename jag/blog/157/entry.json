  "body" : "I'm spending the week in Bangkok talking to developers, customers\nand the press. I did a keynote yesterday morning a the <a href=\n\"http://developers.sun.com/events/techdays/\">TechDays</a>\nconference. The event was pretty seriously over-subscribed: the\nmain keynote room could only fit 1300, and it was packed, with a\npile more people in an overflow roon. Had a lot of fun, including\npulling out my trusty 3-person slingshot to send t-shirts into the\naudience. \n\n<p><b>Do your own t-shirt hurling!</b> There are only a few weeks\nleft to get your proposal in to the <a href=\n\"https://tshc.dev.java.net/rules/\">JavaOne t-shirt hurling\ncontest</a>. Lots of fun, prizes, free JavaOne passes and a chance\nto show off your inner geek.<br>\n</p>\n\n",
