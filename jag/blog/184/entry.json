  "body" : "In the past few years I've managed to do several blog entries a day\nfrom JavaOne. This time around, there was just no way. JavaOne this\nyear was way too hectec. Way too packed with cool stuff. \n\n<p>The After Dark party on Thursday was a lot of fun. The\nMythbuster guys were a riot to talk to. They helped judge the\nt-shirt contest this year. First prize went to \"Didactic Whoosh\":\nRoberto Diaz, Chris Wilson, Iian Klinghofer, Mike Hollatz and Mitch\nMcCuiston. They built a 6 barreled cannon that was a wonder to\nbehold: solid engineering and (amazingly) no weird parts that\ncouldn't be found at a local hardward store. They used standard\nsprinkler valves which conventional wisdom says don't have wide\nenough throats or fast enough opening times to work properly, but\nthey did. It was quite a thundering spectacle when all six barrels\nfired at once.</p>\n\n<p>Second place went to \"Chariot Solutions\": Rob Butler, Dmitry\nSklyut and Andy Oswald whole slammed together a chainsaw and what\nwas roughly a baseball pitching machine. It didn't work as well as\nit should have because at the last minute the Fire Marshall made\nthem get rid of the powerful gas chainsaw that they originall built\nit with and substitute a somewhat wimpy electric chainsaw - the\nissue was the fumes laden with uncombusted gasoline that the engine\nspews.</p>\n\n<p>Third place wend to \" World Cup Champions\": Bruno Souza,\nLeonardo Galvao and Vinicius Senger. They're from soccer-mad Brazil\nand produced a launcher what was a performance-art piece. When\nchoosing between the second and third place teams I said to Adam\nSavage \"It looks like a choice between style and mayhem\". His\nanswer was roughly \"In my book, mayhem always wins\".</p>\n\n<p>The contest was great fun. Thanks to all the teams for all the\ntime you put into your entries. It worked really well doing the\ncontest during the party. Beer and mayhem: yum! Think up some great\nhurling ideas for next year!</p>\n\n<p>I had to duck out of the party early because we were rehearsing\nthe Friday morning keynote during the second half of the party.</p>\n\n<p><b>The other piece of geek craziness</b> was the slot car racing\nprogramming challenge. By Thursday afternoon when it was getting\ndown to the wire for choosing the three finalists, the race track\narea in the pavillion got seriously crushed with people (it was\nalways pretty crowded). Hackers were getting pretty creative with\nthings like acceleration profiles and inventing antilock breaking\nalgorithms - the name of the game is keeping the tires in static\ncontact with the track, as soon as they start sliding life gets\npretty tough. At the end of Thursday the three finalists were Peter\nWhitfield, Robert Chou and a team of 4 university and high school\nstudents: Anna Partheil, Michael Partheil, David Jahn and Georg\nWetter (they got to JavaOne by winning a programming contest in\nGermany). After the pavillion closed, the track was moved to the\nstage in the main hall and the finalists got some time to practice\nand tune. When they first ran, all of their cars flew off the\ntrack. So they all actually started to carefully <i>de</i>tune\ntheir entries, since they all wanted to finish the race with no\naerobatics. By the time the final race happened, everyone stayed on\nthe track for the whole race. Peter got first place, followed by\nthe German students, and then by Robert. It was a great race:\nthanks everyone. Thanks especially to Greg Bollella, our lead real\ntime geek, who was the driving force that made it all happen.</p>\n\n<p><b>It wasn't all fun</b>, I did have some serious work to do. My\nkeynote on Friday morning was all demos with color commentary. The\ndemos were:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Tom Ball showing off the <a href=\n  \"http://jackpot.netbeans.org/\">Jackpot</a>\n  refactoring/reengineering engine for NetBeans. It opens up the\n  whole concept of refactoring to all sorts of user-defined\n  transformations. For example, it can be used for eliminating\n  deprecated methods, migrating APIs, doing code cleanup or\n  enforcing coding standards.</li>\n\n  <li>Next up were Petr Suchomel and Martin Brehovsky from the\n  NetBeans mobility team who put together a great\n  end-to-center-to-end demo. At one end they connected an RFID\n  reader to an embedded controller running JavaME with the guts of\n  a cellphone for connectivity - even though it's not a \"cellphone\"\n  NetBeans mobility did a great job of enabling the development of\n  the code. In the center was an app server (in Prague) that\n  implemented a suite of web services for package tracking. At the\n  other end was a cell phone running a couple of apps (written in\n  JavaME using NetBeans, of course) that made it possible to first\n  register interest in a particular package, and second react when\n  notified via push-SMS from the app server when the package was\n  seen on the RFID reader.</li>\n\n  <li>\n    This was followed by Nedim Fresco and Hinkmond Wong showing off\n    the cool features of <a href=\n    \"http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=209\">JSR 209</a>, which\n    brings a large part of Swing and Graphics2D to JavaME/CDC. High\n    performance imaging... the ability to use GUI editors like\n    Matisse... multithreading... lovely! \n\n    <p>As an added bonus, Nandini Ramani (with some help from folks\n    at SavaJe) ported the leaderboard app I had written for the\n    slot car race to the SavaJe phone. It was apparently a trivial\n    task, except for a bug (in my code) where I had a timeout in\n    some network error recovery code that was a little too tight\n    for the latency of socket connection through the cellphone\n    network.</p>\n  </li>\n\n  <li>\n    Then came Greg Bollella talking about the next generation of\n    our real time VM that incorporates a new garbage collector\n    based on some research from the <a href=\n    \"http://www.cs.lth.se/Research/ProgEnv/RT-GC.html\">University\n    of Lund</a>. It gets really interesting when you put an app\n    server (with 5 hours of tweaking to take advantage of a few RT\n    features) on top of it. They did a benchmark where they set up\n    the app server to serve two ports that were identical except\n    that one serviced requests using regular threads, the other\n    serviced requests using real time threads. Then they loaded up\n    the server with a bunch of other tasks to slow things down and\n    turn it into something of a worst-case situation. Here's a\n    graph of the distribution of request response times:<br>\n\n    <p><br>\n    The red bars are from the real time threads, the blue are\n    normal threads. To be fair to the non-real time numbers, I\n    should point out that the graph was rendered with the red bars\n    on top of the blue bars, and a large number of the non-RT\n    responses are hidden under the red bars. As you can see, the\n    real time server has tightly bounded response times, where the\n    other has a significant number of outlyers. This isn't just the\n    result of a rocket-science garbage collector: paying close\n    attention to RT issues like queueing, scheduling and priority\n    inversion all have a noticable effect. These dramatically great\n    numbers don't come for free: there is a tradeoff between\n    predicable timing and aggregate throughput. Most software\n    optimizes for throughput, and this is generally the right thing\n    to do. But sometimes, timing is more important.</p>\n  </li>\n\n  <li>Next came the slot car race, which I've already\n  mentioned.</li>\n\n  <li>Lastly, I finished with a tour through <a href=\n  \"http://www.teamjefferson.com/index.htm\">Tommy</a>, the DARPA\n  Grand Challenge vehicle build by Paul Perrone of <a href=\n  \"http://www.perronerobotics.com/pri.html\">Perrone Robotics</a>.\n  It's a lovely piece of work about which much has been <a href=\n  \"http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Interviews/perrone_qa.html\">written</a>.\n  A clean architecture... AI and device control all in Java on\n  three processor boards.</li>\n</ol>Afterwards I rushed off to a 2nd grade art fair at my youngest\ndaughters school. My apologies to folks from The Press who were at\nthe press conference with Scott and I after my morning keynote: no\none told me about it until just after my keynote, as I was\nrocketing out of the room. \n\n<p>After over a month of not getting more that 4 hours sleep a\nnight, I finally got home and slept...</p>\n\n",
