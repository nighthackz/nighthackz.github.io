<div class=entry><h1>JavaOne, day 4+</h1>
In the past few years I've managed to do several blog entries a day
from JavaOne. This time around, there was just no way. JavaOne this
year was way too hectec. Way too packed with cool stuff. 

<p>The After Dark party on Thursday was a lot of fun. The
Mythbuster guys were a riot to talk to. They helped judge the
t-shirt contest this year. First prize went to "Didactic Whoosh":
Roberto Diaz, Chris Wilson, Iian Klinghofer, Mike Hollatz and Mitch
McCuiston. They built a 6 barreled cannon that was a wonder to
behold: solid engineering and (amazingly) no weird parts that
couldn't be found at a local hardward store. They used standard
sprinkler valves which conventional wisdom says don't have wide
enough throats or fast enough opening times to work properly, but
they did. It was quite a thundering spectacle when all six barrels
fired at once.</p>

<p>Second place went to "Chariot Solutions": Rob Butler, Dmitry
Sklyut and Andy Oswald whole slammed together a chainsaw and what
was roughly a baseball pitching machine. It didn't work as well as
it should have because at the last minute the Fire Marshall made
them get rid of the powerful gas chainsaw that they originall built
it with and substitute a somewhat wimpy electric chainsaw - the
issue was the fumes laden with uncombusted gasoline that the engine
spews.</p>

<p>Third place wend to " World Cup Champions": Bruno Souza,
Leonardo Galvao and Vinicius Senger. They're from soccer-mad Brazil
and produced a launcher what was a performance-art piece. When
choosing between the second and third place teams I said to Adam
Savage "It looks like a choice between style and mayhem". His
answer was roughly "In my book, mayhem always wins".</p>

<p>The contest was great fun. Thanks to all the teams for all the
time you put into your entries. It worked really well doing the
contest during the party. Beer and mayhem: yum! Think up some great
hurling ideas for next year!</p>

<p>I had to duck out of the party early because we were rehearsing
the Friday morning keynote during the second half of the party.</p>

<p><b>The other piece of geek craziness</b> was the slot car racing
programming challenge. By Thursday afternoon when it was getting
down to the wire for choosing the three finalists, the race track
area in the pavillion got seriously crushed with people (it was
always pretty crowded). Hackers were getting pretty creative with
things like acceleration profiles and inventing antilock breaking
algorithms - the name of the game is keeping the tires in static
contact with the track, as soon as they start sliding life gets
pretty tough. At the end of Thursday the three finalists were Peter
Whitfield, Robert Chou and a team of 4 university and high school
students: Anna Partheil, Michael Partheil, David Jahn and Georg
Wetter (they got to JavaOne by winning a programming contest in
Germany). After the pavillion closed, the track was moved to the
stage in the main hall and the finalists got some time to practice
and tune. When they first ran, all of their cars flew off the
track. So they all actually started to carefully <i>de</i>tune
their entries, since they all wanted to finish the race with no
aerobatics. By the time the final race happened, everyone stayed on
the track for the whole race. Peter got first place, followed by
the German students, and then by Robert. It was a great race:
thanks everyone. Thanks especially to Greg Bollella, our lead real
time geek, who was the driving force that made it all happen.</p>

<p><b>It wasn't all fun</b>, I did have some serious work to do. My
keynote on Friday morning was all demos with color commentary. The
demos were:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Tom Ball showing off the <a href=
  "http://jackpot.netbeans.org/">Jackpot</a>
  refactoring/reengineering engine for NetBeans. It opens up the
  whole concept of refactoring to all sorts of user-defined
  transformations. For example, it can be used for eliminating
  deprecated methods, migrating APIs, doing code cleanup or
  enforcing coding standards.</li>

  <li>Next up were Petr Suchomel and Martin Brehovsky from the
  NetBeans mobility team who put together a great
  end-to-center-to-end demo. At one end they connected an RFID
  reader to an embedded controller running JavaME with the guts of
  a cellphone for connectivity - even though it's not a "cellphone"
  NetBeans mobility did a great job of enabling the development of
  the code. In the center was an app server (in Prague) that
  implemented a suite of web services for package tracking. At the
  other end was a cell phone running a couple of apps (written in
  JavaME using NetBeans, of course) that made it possible to first
  register interest in a particular package, and second react when
  notified via push-SMS from the app server when the package was
  seen on the RFID reader.</li>

  <li>
    This was followed by Nedim Fresco and Hinkmond Wong showing off
    the cool features of <a href=
    "http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=209">JSR 209</a>, which
    brings a large part of Swing and Graphics2D to JavaME/CDC. High
    performance imaging... the ability to use GUI editors like
    Matisse... multithreading... lovely! 

    <p>As an added bonus, Nandini Ramani (with some help from folks
    at SavaJe) ported the leaderboard app I had written for the
    slot car race to the SavaJe phone. It was apparently a trivial
    task, except for a bug (in my code) where I had a timeout in
    some network error recovery code that was a little too tight
    for the latency of socket connection through the cellphone
    network.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    Then came Greg Bollella talking about the next generation of
    our real time VM that incorporates a new garbage collector
    based on some research from the <a href=
    "http://www.cs.lth.se/Research/ProgEnv/RT-GC.html">University
    of Lund</a>. It gets really interesting when you put an app
    server (with 5 hours of tweaking to take advantage of a few RT
    features) on top of it. They did a benchmark where they set up
    the app server to serve two ports that were identical except
    that one serviced requests using regular threads, the other
    serviced requests using real time threads. Then they loaded up
    the server with a bunch of other tasks to slow things down and
    turn it into something of a worst-case situation. Here's a
    graph of the distribution of request response times:<br>

    <p><br>
    The red bars are from the real time threads, the blue are
    normal threads. To be fair to the non-real time numbers, I
    should point out that the graph was rendered with the red bars
    on top of the blue bars, and a large number of the non-RT
    responses are hidden under the red bars. As you can see, the
    real time server has tightly bounded response times, where the
    other has a significant number of outlyers. This isn't just the
    result of a rocket-science garbage collector: paying close
    attention to RT issues like queueing, scheduling and priority
    inversion all have a noticable effect. These dramatically great
    numbers don't come for free: there is a tradeoff between
    predicable timing and aggregate throughput. Most software
    optimizes for throughput, and this is generally the right thing
    to do. But sometimes, timing is more important.</p>
  </li>

  <li>Next came the slot car race, which I've already
  mentioned.</li>

  <li>Lastly, I finished with a tour through <a href=
  "http://www.teamjefferson.com/index.htm">Tommy</a>, the DARPA
  Grand Challenge vehicle build by Paul Perrone of <a href=
  "http://www.perronerobotics.com/pri.html">Perrone Robotics</a>.
  It's a lovely piece of work about which much has been <a href=
  "http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Interviews/perrone_qa.html">written</a>.
  A clean architecture... AI and device control all in Java on
  three processor boards.</li>
</ol>Afterwards I rushed off to a 2nd grade art fair at my youngest
daughters school. My apologies to folks from The Press who were at
the press conference with Scott and I after my morning keynote: no
one told me about it until just after my keynote, as I was
rocketing out of the room. 

<p>After over a month of not getting more that 4 hours sleep a
night, I finally got home and slept...</p>
