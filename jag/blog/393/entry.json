Google: Ex-Sun execs on opposite\nsides\"</a> he got my position on the case totally backwards and\ntotally misinterpreted my comments. Just because Sun didn't have\npatent suits in our genetic code doesn't mean we didn't feel\nwronged. While I have differences with Oracle, in this case they\nare in the right. Google totally slimed Sun. We were all really\ndisturbed, even Jonathan: he just decided to put on a happy face\nand tried to turn lemons into lemonade, which annoyed a lot of\nfolks at Sun.</p>\n\n",
