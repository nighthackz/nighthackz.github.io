  "body" : "Running keynote sessions at a conference with the scale of JavaOne\nis a pretty daunting task. Behind the screen there is a huge crew\nmanaging some pretty awesome technology. All of the video cameras\nand streams were full HDTV. That huge screen behind the stage was\namazing: one giant framebuffer driving four independent projectors,\ncarefully aligned, to provide one seamless image surface. This is\nthe first time that this projection technology has been used:\nJavaOne was the beta-test. It was flawless. The crew was wonderful.\n",
