It's been quite a roller coaster.\nSeeing what people have done with Java over the years has been\ntotally awe-inspiring. \n\n<p>Now is also roughly the time when JavaOne would have been\nhappening. Mostly because it's fun (and great therapy), I whipped\nup a <a href=\n\"http://duke.kenai.com/tshirts/TShirt2010/index.html\">couple of\nimages</a> that Oracle could use for t-shirts if they'd like. I'd\nlike to think that they'll pull a <span title=\n\"But my experience with them says that their hat is mostly filled with spiders. I'd love to be wrong\">rabbit\nout of a hat</span> when they do their version of JavaOne in the\nfall, and end up with something cool and interesting.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to those who \"liked\" me on the <a href=\n\"http://25yearsof.com\">25 years of .com</a> site. I'm not quite 10x\nOracle's score, but I'm pretty comfortably ahead.</p>\n\n",
