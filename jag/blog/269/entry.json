It was\nnice to see some <a href=\n\"http://www.oreillynet.com/onjava/blog/2008/04/java_tracking_basketballs_from_1.html\">blogosphere\npickup from Tim O'Brien</a>. Projects like this have quite a\nrigorous evaluation process to get to the start of deployment. One\nof the fun things about the realtime version of Java is that it\ngets us involved in all sorts of fascinating systems. It's not real\nengineering until megawatts are involved. :-) Today's customer\nvisit involved folks in the gigawatt range... \n\n<p>JavaOne coolness is getting over the top. A fair number of\nhotels are already sold out. For the past several years we've been\nback on a track of annual serious escalation. Choosing demos,\njudging awards, figuring out what goes into the keynotes and\nsessions is real tough. There are a bunch more sessions this year\n(we found some more space to book). The t-shirt launching contest\nisn't happening: one of the big reasons is that everything else is\nsqueezed so tight that something had to give. :-(</p>\n\n",
