  "body" : "I spent the morning speaking at an internal conference of PayPal's\nengineering organization. They had invited me to give a talk on how\nto do innovation. I don't know if I said anything useful in between\nthe cynical rants :-) but I had a good time. They've got a great\ncrew of engineers putting together a new generation of APIs for\ndoing commerce. I had used their old APIs in previous projects, but\nwhen the current round of work on store.java.com got started in Sun\nwe started using the <a href=\n\"https://www.x.com/community/ppx/documentation\">new \"adaptive\"\nAPIs</a>. Lovely!\n",
