  "body" : "Last week we had an all-hands meeting of the Java &amp; Tools folks\nat Sun. Just to freak everyone out I actually wore a suit, for the\nfirst time since the US v Microsoft trial. We also got a bunch of\npeople (including me) to volunteer for a dunk tank. This is a\npicture of me, in suit, just before I dropped into the water. The\nsuit was wool, and it was a hot day. I was really looking forward\nto getting dunked. If anyone has a picture of me falling into the\nwater, please send me a copy.\n\n<p><i>Thanks to Alan Monday for this picture.</i></p>\n\n",
