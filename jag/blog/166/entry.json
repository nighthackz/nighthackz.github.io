  "body" : "<a href=\"http://www.toad.com/gnu/\">John Gilmore</a> was going\nthrough some old backup cartridge tapes. He stumbled on the\nfollowing email. \"shar\" was old in 82... I think I actually wrote\nthe script in the email in 78 or 79. \n\n<p>Bits and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme\">meme</a>s\nnever die.</p>\n<pre>\nFrom decwrl!decvax!microsof!uw-beave!jim Mon Oct 18 11:08:34 1982\nSubject: Shell archiver\nNewsgroups: net.sources\n\nI see a lot of sources posted here which consist of several files, all\ncatted together, and then I have to edit the source to extract all the\nfiles.  Here is a simple shell script which will package up a bunch of files\ninto a \"shell archive\", which when used as input to a shell, will extract\nthe constituent files (is that perfectly clear?).  For example, if I want to\ndistribute a program consisting of files foo1.c, foo2.c, and makefile, I\nwould type \"shar archive foo1.c foo2.c makefile\" and I would then post\n\"archive\" to the net.  Recipients would then run the archive into their\nshell and would get back the original files.  Here it is:\n\n# shar -- Shell archiver\nAR=$1\nshift\nfor i do\n        echo a - $i\n        echo \"echo x - $i\" &gt;&gt;$AR\n        echo \"cat &gt;$i &lt;&lt;'!Funky!Stuff!'\" &gt;&gt;$AR\n        cat $i &gt;&gt;$AR\n        echo \"!Funky!Stuff!\" &gt;&gt;$AR\ndone\n\nThanks to James Gosling at CMU for this idea.\n</pre>\n\n",
