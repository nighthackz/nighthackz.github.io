  "body" : "I was out last week (it was winter break here in the US: most\nschools had a holiday) and ended up on a beach with no internet\nconnection playing endless games of \"Marco Polo\" with my 8 year\nold. Such a hardship. \n\n<p>I missed out on last week's excitement of the preview releases\nof <a href=\n\"http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/roumen?entry=netbeans_ide_5_5_preview\">NetBeans\n5.5</a> and <a href=\"http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/index.jsp\">Java\nEE 5</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This week is a little quieter, but I'm pretty charged up by the\nrecent progress of the <a href=\"http://bluej.org/\">BlueJ</a>\nproject. It's a very specialized IDE for teaching people to program\nwho have never programmed before. There's a textbook for it. It's\nbeen a pretty popular tool for teaching introductory computer\nscience courses. They've had a bunch of stuff going at at <a href=\n\"http://bluej.org/bluej-day.html\">SIGCSE</a> this week. Friday\nevening there will be a <a href=\n\"http://www.netbeans.org/community/articles/SIGCSE2006.html\">reception</a>\nwhere (among other things) folks will be showing off the\ninterconnections between BlueJ and NetBeans so that as students\nbecome proficient they can easily migrate up to more sophisticated\nprofessional tools.</p>\n\n",
