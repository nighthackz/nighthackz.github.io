<div class=entry><h1>RIP: Pink Flamingo, 1957-2006</h1>
An old friend sent me a note to point out the <a href=
"http://www.sun-sentinel.com/features/lifestyle/sfl-hg20flamingooct20,0,4474139.story?coll=sfla-features-headlines">passing
of the company that made the original pink plastic lawn
flamingo</a>. She figured I wanted to know since pink flamingos
were involved in my first mention in a newspaper article. The story
goes like this: 

<p>I was working at a place called the Information Technology
Center at Carnegie-Mellon University, funded by IBM. A new building
was being built for the center. We moved in before the building was
completed. It was quite a piece of modern architecture. A building
that architects get awards for. Sleek and unrelentingly black.
Surfaces that only Steve Jobs and Darth Vader could love. It had a
terraced pyramid-ish shape. This was 1984.</p>

<p>Shortly after moving in, several of us were in a bar down the
street, downing beers and bitching about the blackness of the
building we now worked in. Someone at the table said something like
"it needs a bit of color - like a pink flamingo". I'm not smart
enough to come up with that idea, but I am dumb enough to implement
it. I went to a local gardening store and bought a couple of
flamingos, mounted them on a little wooden platform and placed them
on the little rooflet-thing outside my office window. It was a
thing of beauty. The flamingos were small, but intensely pink. From
many blocks away, they were clearly visible. Tiny pink dots in this
immense blackness. Sitting in my office I could watch people
stopping on roads and sidewalks and staring, trying to figure out
what the bright pink beacons were.</p>

<p>Many forms of hell broke loose. One of my favorite happened one
day when I was sitting in my office hacking away with my door open.
The building was finally completed and representatives of the
university, the contractor and the architect were doing a
walk-through to hand-off the building from the construction company
to the university. They happened to walk down the hall by my
office. Through my open door, past me, and out the window, the
flamingos were <i>clearly</i> visible. The architect really lost
it. He hated the flamingos. He started yelling at the contractor
who (roughly) deadpanned "We didn't put it there. It's outside the
scope of the contract. It's not our responsibility". The university
folks tried to get me to remove it, but I pointed out that I didn't
work for them (I worked for IBM - it was an odd arrangement). So
they departed down the hall with the architect ranting. But the
Flamingos stood.</p>

<p>Bombs started going off in the University administration. Work
orders were issued. Memos to have me reprimanded got issued. But
somehow the admins and maintenance folks who actually run the place
managed to make none of these things actually happen. It got noisy
enough that the Pittsburgh Post Gazette did a story about it.</p>

<p>A month or two later I accepted a job offer at Sun and headed
off to California. I got off the plane, rented a car, and drove to
the house that I had rented from a friend. As I drove up to the
house, there was quite a crowd on the sidewalks: some folks at Sun
had gone out and bought every plastic flamingo from every garden
shop for miles around and stuck them on the lawn in front of the
house. Newspaper article #2.</p>

<p>So I start working at Sun. After a few weeks I take all the
flamingos off my lawn and put them in a big heap in my garage. I
keep getting emails from folks at CMU about the flamingos. Quite a
cottage industry had sprung up to protect them. And they started to
spread. One of the maintenance crews who had an electric mini-truck
to drive around campus took a flamingo and sawed it in half
vertically from nose to tail. Then they glued the left and right
sides of the flamingo to the doors of the truck. Made quite a sight
driving around.</p>

<p>Getting close to Chistmas I came up with an idea for disposing
of the heap of flamingos in my driveway: I made a Santa costume to
fit a flamingo and built a flamingo-sized sleigh for him to ride
in. I then placed Santa Flamingo in his sleigh pulled by
rein-flamingos in the gardens next to Sun's building (manufacturing
was downstairs; engineering, sales, marketing and administration
were upstairs). I had enough flamingos to make a complete second
Santa Flamingo set, which I mailed off to CMU.</p>

<p>Quite by accident, my timing was excellent. Unknown to me, while
the box was in transit, one night a frat across the street scaled
the building and stole my pair of flamingos. The frat brothers
victory didn't last long: the Santa kit showed up almost immediatly
and magically where once there had been two flamingos, there were
now 9.</p>

<p>I still have some left, fading and in my garage.</p>

<p>The big tragedy is that I have <b>no</b> pictures of any of
this. So if any old friends are reading this, I'd love to get scans
of any photos you might have.</p>
