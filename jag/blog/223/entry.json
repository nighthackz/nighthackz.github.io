  "body" : "Once again, I'm doing the closing keynote at JavaOne. Through some\npiece of odd mystery math, this year I'ved ended up with two hours\nof time, which had me paniced: what would I do to fill all that\ntime? The last few years my talks have pretty much devolved to\nbeing pure demos: (almost) no slides, just folks up on stage with\nme, having a conversation about the cool toys they're showing off.\nThis year I figured that the problem in structuring my talk would\nbe finding cool stuff to show off, not picking... But no... We\nended up with a huge cool-stuff list: easily the longest we've ever\nhad. The choices were pretty hard. It's going to be a lot of fun. \n\n<p>There were a surprising number of cool desktop (GUI) things to\nshow off. Despite prophecies of doom in the press, Think Again!\nThere's some great life on the desktop. I really wanted them, but\n<a href=\"http://blogs.sun.com/brewin/\">Bob Brewin</a> ended up with\nthem in his talk - in a first for JavaOne, we're actually\ncoordinating the Sun keynotes. Duh. :-)</p>\n\n",
