  "body" : "Last years JavaOne was the most exciting ever. I thought that it\nwas actually more exciting than the early years: there was less\nhype and promise, and a lot more reality. I'm a blue-collar kinda\nguy: I like stuff that's real. Paper sketches don't excite me\nnearly as much, even though they're necessary at the beginning.\n\n<p>After the bursting of the bubble, it was great to see life\ncoming back into the industry. I was just talking to some the the\nconference organizers, and based on early registrations JavaOne\nthis year is going to be noticably bigger than last year. Should be\nfun. My schedule is already a nightmare. Sleep will be a rare\nthing. Too many parties!</p>\n\n",
