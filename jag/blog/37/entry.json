They've got quite a pile of cool stuff to talk about and\nshow off. I'll be there, giving a talk in the morning to help kick\nthings off. They've packed the day with a wide range of material,\nincluding all the new stuff in NetBeans 4 and the tools for\ndeveloping mobile applications. It's even better than free, it has\na negative price...
