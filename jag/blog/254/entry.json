  "body" : "I spent the end of last week in Geneva visiting <a href=\n\"http://public.web.cern.ch/Public/Welcome.html\">CERN</a>. I spent\nmost of my time talking to Java developers there, of which there\nare a lot. They graciously gave me a tour of the <a href=\n\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider\">Large Hadron\nCollider</a>, which was a real thrill for a geek like me. It's an\namazing piece of engineering. \n\n<p>At the end of Friday I visited <a href=\n\"http://unosat.web.cern.ch/unosat/\">UNOSAT</a>, a small UN agency\nhosted by CERN that uses satellite imagery to build maps to aid\nother UN agencies. Most often to get up-to-the-minute geographic\ninformation for disaster relief.</p>\n\n<p>Today has been mostly customer meetings in Frankfurt.</p>\n\n<p>The big thrill has been the FCS of <a href=\n\"http://netbeans.org\">Netbeans 6.0</a>. Well done folks! I've been\ndownloading the alphas, betas and release candidates all along, and\nI've been incredibly happy with it. In my daily life I mostly\nnotice the changes to the editor, which are dramatic. But there's a\nlot more. The <a href=\n\"http://www.netbeans.org/features/index.html\">feature list</a> is\nlong.</p>\n\n<p>If you happen to be in or around Frankfurt over the next few\ndays, we're doing a <a href=\n\"http://de.sun.com/sunnews/events/2007/20071203/index.html\">Tech\nDays</a> event. Lots of experts giving lots of talks on all the\nlatest happenings.</p>\n\n<p>Next week: <a>JavaPolis</a> in Antwerp, Belgium. Tragically,\nit's sold out. If you haven't registered yet, you're out of\nluck.</p>\n\n",
