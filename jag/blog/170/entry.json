The winners were Roberto Diaz, Rob Butler and Bruno Souza\n  (yes, we have our first Brazilian finalist: I'm expecting madness\n  (in a good way)).</li>\n\n  <li>JavaOne's growth this year has put some serious strain on\n  keynote scheduling so we've had to move the t-shirt hurling\n  contest from the keynotes into the AfterDark party on Thursday\n  night. The ceiling is very high: lots of room for crazy\n  projectiles.</li>\n\n  <li>We did a run-through of candidate keynote demos last week.\n  They're looking pretty sweet. The <a href=\n  \"http://swinglabs.org/index.jsp\">SwingLabs folks</a> did a\n  particularly stunning job.</li>\n\n  <li>Picking the Dukes Choice winners has never been harder.</li>\n\n  <li>I've been doing some heavy NetBeans plugin module hacking for\n  a little JavaOne fun. I had been pretty happy with the plugin\n  module development facilities when I was just dabbling. Now I'm\n  deep into it, and happier.</li>\n\n  <li>In the midst of the course in advanced sleep deprivation that\n  is the preparation for JavaOne, I'm ending up going to Java Tech\n  Days in Moscow and Johannesburg. I'm a glutton for\n  punishment.</li>\n\n  <li>Next week (April 11-12) we're doing a Tech Days event in Sao\n  Paulo where my boss, Jeff Jackson, will be speaking.</li>\n\n  <li>The low point of the week will be going through yet another\n  <a href=\n  \"http://www.answers.com/topic/deposition?method=5&amp;linktext=Deposition\">deposition</a>.\n  This time in a patent case where it is belived that something I\n  did years ago is prior art.</li>\n</ul>\n",
