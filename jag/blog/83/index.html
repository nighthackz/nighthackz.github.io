<td valign=top class=content><div class=entry><h1>Brazialian National Healthcare</h1>
Late last year I went on a trip to Brazil to talk at a Java
conference. While I was there I got taken on a customer visit to
see the new software infrastructure for the Brazialian National
Healthcare sytem. I keep getting asked about it, so I thought it
would be good to post a note here, even though the visit happened
months ago. The system hasn't been fully deployed yet, they've just
done a test deployment, but they're very happy with it. Their test
deployment was 12 million (12,000,000!) people in 44 cities. 

<p>It's the "operating system" for Brazilian National Healthcare.
It's huge bags of J2EE and J2SE code. In the center, they have some
serious servers (E10Ks &amp;c) with large amounts of storage. This
is actually physically in 5 sites with serious security. These are
fed through a hierarchy of regional servers from hospitals, clinics
and pharmacies.</p>

<p>Every interaction between a health care professional and a
patient is recorded in the system. Every patient has a national
medical system card. Every scrap of data is in the database.
X-rays. EKGs. Video recordings from endoscopic exams. Some of these
are entered/scanned manually, but many are streamed directly from
the instruments. You can even remotely examine data as it is being
streamed into the database, giving you live access to the
instruments in an in-progress encounter. The person who was showing
the system to me was a cardiac surgeon. As she was giving me the
walkthrough on all of this, she hopped (in the cyberspace sense)
into an in-progress heart transplant and took me on a tour through
all the instruments. I also got the required video tour through a
rectal exam, which seemed to be standard surgeon humor :-)</p>

<p>These folks use every Java API you can imagine. They're
critically dependent on many of the ones that we (in a corporate
sense) frequently denigrate like Advanced Imaging and Media. After
all, what good is it to record video if you can't view it?</p>

<p>This system has already paid for itself several times over, just
in cutting out drug fraud: when you go to a doctor they can see
every other doctors visit you've been in for, every test result,
and every prescription. This helps them enormously in getting a
clear picture of what has been going on with a patient. For
example, if a patient just got a prescription for Prozac from one
doctor yesterday, they can't get a new one from another doctor
today. Then when they go into the Pharmacy, they don't hand the
druggist a scrap of paper, they had them their medical ID card, and
the doctor gets the prescription out of the database, and marks it
in the database as having been filled.</p>

<p>They even have specialized terminals for clinics in the Amazon
jungle. This led to a discussion of one of their more amusing
problems: they don't know the names of many of their patients
because in many indigenous religions, disclosing your name is the
same as handing over your soul. (I feel that way myself a lot of
the time). So they teach the indians that the medical ID card is
roughly a magic talisman that helps the people in the clinic do
their medicine. The medical system doesn't need to know the
identity of its patients, it merely has to correlate people to
medical records.</p>

<p>Right now, the ID card is a traditional magstripe card, but
JavaCards have recently gotten cheap enough for them to consider.
The current deployments don't use much J2ME, but they likely will
soon. This is motivated by the fact that J2ME cell phones &amp;
wireless PDAs now work in all sorts of obscure areas, and will
allow them to get rid of their current generation of rather clumsy
non-desktop terminals.</p>

<p>I wish the medical system I use here in the Bay Area was this
coordinated.</p>
