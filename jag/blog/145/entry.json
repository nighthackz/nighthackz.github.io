Joseph\nMcCarthy. It's a nicely done film about an important incident that\nhas eerie parallel's to today. I saw it at an art house theater\n(the Guild in Menlo Park, CA), where the line to get in was very\nlong, and many people did not get in because the film sold out -\nand this was several weeks after the film opened. Tragically, it\nonly seems to be showing in art house theaters, and I doubt that\nit's getting seen much in <a href=\n\"http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/\" shape=\"rect\">Red\nStates</a>. \n\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">In one of those odd connections that\nfate makes, the technical publications group in the Java\norganisation at Sun was run for years by <a href=\n\"http://www.girlgeeks.org/innergeek/inspiringwomen/friendly.shtml\"\nshape=\"rect\">Lisa Friendly</a>, Fred Friendly's daughter.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">PS. Bonus points to the folks that put\ntogether <a href=\"http://www.schwarzeneggerstreet.com/\" shape=\n\"rect\">SchwarzeneggerStreet.com</a></p>\n\n",
