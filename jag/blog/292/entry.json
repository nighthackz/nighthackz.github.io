  "body" : "Between family and job I end up always being pretty busy. I like\nplaying video games, but getting a block of time long enough to put\ninto any of the Big Games is pretty much impossible. So I'm always\nlooking for games that you can play quickly and get a thrill-buzz\nin just a few minutes. After about a billion rounds, the attraction\nof Solitaire has worn pretty thin. Lately I've been playing <a\nhref=\"http://www.puppygames.net/titan-attacks/\">Titan Attacks</a>\nfrom the folks at <a href=\n\"http://www.puppygames.net/\">PuppyGames</a>. It's got a great\nkickback-in-a-bar-with-a-beer arcade feel to it. Thanks <a href=\n\"http://www.puppygames.net/blog/\">Cas</a>! \n\n<p>PS. If you try it out, and you like it, consider paying for it:\nthat'll help more great new games happen.</p>\n\n",
