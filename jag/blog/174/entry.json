  "body" : "I'm just finishing up two great (but tiring!) days in Moscow. We've\nhad a crew of evangelists and engineers doing non-stop detailed\ntechnical presentations. There are a lot of great bright engineers\nhere. The event was held in the headquarters of the Russian Academy\nof Sciences - a building with the <a href=\n\"resource/RussianAcademyOfScience.jpg\">world's coolest clock</a> on\ntop. I had to go for the ritual wander through Red Square and get a\ntypical tourist photo. Lots of fun. It's a great place. The psycho\nthing is that we're doing another one of these in Johannesburg in\ntwo weeks... <br clear=\"both\">\n\n",
