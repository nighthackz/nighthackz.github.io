Sun's former Chief Gaming Officer, <a href=\n\"http://www.pastpixels.com/\">Chris Mellisinos</a>, has been a major\ndriver behind the exhibit. It looks like it's going to be wickedly\ncool [at least, to those of you who like video games :-) ] But\nthere's a problem: the funding situation is a little tight\n(surprise!!). So they're <a href=\n\"http://americanart.si.edu/support/credits/index.cfm\">looking for\ndonations</a>. Please, if you can, give a few dollars to show that\ngaming is for real. And if you know anyone at a gaming company,\nprod them into making a serious <a href=\n\"http://americanart.si.edu/support/credits/index.cfm\">donation</a>\nby contacting <a href=\n\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/chrism\">Chris</a>.\n",
