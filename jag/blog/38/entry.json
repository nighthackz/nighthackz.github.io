The t-shirt hurling contestants are\nfinishing off their devices. The three finalists were chosen a\nwhile ago. They'll each be launching at one of the Sun keynote\nsessions. The last will launch during my keynote session on\nThursday, where we'll show short videos of the other two launches\nand have the audience vote on the winner. Support the contest and\nbuy a t-shirt at <a href=\"http://cafepress.com/duketoss\" shape=\n\"rect\">CafePress</a>.\n",
