  "body" : "I'm in Australia this week giving some talks and visiting folks.\nYesterday I was in Newcastle speaking at the <a href=\n\"http://www.cs.newcastle.edu.au/~acsw05/speak.html\" shape=\n\"rect\">Australian Computer Society</a>, which was a wonderful\nexperience. A great group of people.\n\n<p>Last night I went out with the folks from <a href=\n\"http://cenqua.com/\" shape=\"rect\">Cenqua</a>, an Australian\nsoftware company that produces some excellent Java tools to help\nwith code quality/coverage and managing the engineering process.\nVery <i>very</i> nice stuff. A very clever crew.</p>\n\n<p>One of them, Matt Quail, who's the fellow I'm with in the lousey\ncellphone picture here, is also the author of <a href=\n\"http://madbean.com/blog/2004/17/totallygridbag.html\" shape=\n\"rect\">Totally Gridbag</a>. He's one of the legion that have a deep\nlove/hate relationship with <a href=\n\"http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/layout/gridbag.html\"\n shape=\"rect\">gridbags</a>. It's another one of these APIs that has\na maze of things you can tweak to achieve essentially anything you\nwant. \"With great power comes great <strike>responsibility</strike>\ncomplexity\". <b>sigh</b>.</p>\n\n<p>We started out by rolling down to a place by the harbour where\nwe could pound back some beers. This was followed by a quick debate\nover where to grab some dinner. They rattled off the names of some\nlocal restaurants that I knew nothing about. Then one of them said\n\"But what we'd really like to do is head over to Bennelong for the\ndeg\". I figured this was some spicy southeast asian food, perfect\nwith beer. I had no clue what they meant by \"deg\", but I let it\nslide since I was more involved in the geek side of the\nconversation. So we wander around to the other side of the harbour\nand walk into the Sydney Opera House where I discover that <a href=\n\"http://www.guillaumeatbennelong.com.au/\" shape=\n\"rect\">Bennelong</a> is actually a very upscale French restaurant.\nThe conversation with the waiter to order dinner was a quick\nclassic piece of Australian banter: \"We're here fer the deg, mate\"\n\"Bon! Cinq pour le menu d&#232;gustation!\". This was followed by\nfive hours of totally wonderful food.</p>\n\n<p>What is it about geeks and food? Yum!</p>\n\n",
