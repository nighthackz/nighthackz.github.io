<img align=right src='Image108-large.jpeg'>I'm in Australia this week giving some talks and visiting folks.
Yesterday I was in Newcastle speaking at the <a href=
"http://www.cs.newcastle.edu.au/~acsw05/speak.html" shape=
"rect">Australian Computer Society</a>, which was a wonderful
experience. A great group of people.

<p>Last night I went out with the folks from <a href=
"http://cenqua.com/" shape="rect">Cenqua</a>, an Australian
software company that produces some excellent Java tools to help
with code quality/coverage and managing the engineering process.
Very <i>very</i> nice stuff. A very clever crew.</p>

<p>One of them, Matt Quail, who's the fellow I'm with in the lousey
cellphone picture here, is also the author of <a href=
"http://madbean.com/blog/2004/17/totallygridbag.html" shape=
"rect">Totally Gridbag</a>. He's one of the legion that have a deep
love/hate relationship with <a href=
"http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/layout/gridbag.html"
 shape="rect">gridbags</a>. It's another one of these APIs that has
a maze of things you can tweak to achieve essentially anything you
want. "With great power comes great <strike>responsibility</strike>
complexity". <b>sigh</b>.</p>

<p>We started out by rolling down to a place by the harbour where
we could pound back some beers. This was followed by a quick debate
over where to grab some dinner. They rattled off the names of some
local restaurants that I knew nothing about. Then one of them said
"But what we'd really like to do is head over to Bennelong for the
deg". I figured this was some spicy southeast asian food, perfect
with beer. I had no clue what they meant by "deg", but I let it
slide since I was more involved in the geek side of the
conversation. So we wander around to the other side of the harbour
and walk into the Sydney Opera House where I discover that <a href=
"http://www.guillaumeatbennelong.com.au/" shape=
"rect">Bennelong</a> is actually a very upscale French restaurant.
The conversation with the waiter to order dinner was a quick
classic piece of Australian banter: "We're here fer the deg, mate"
"Bon! Cinq pour le menu d&#232;gustation!". This was followed by
five hours of totally wonderful food.</p>

<p>What is it about geeks and food? Yum!</p>
