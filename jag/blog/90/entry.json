  "body" : "I'm sitting here at the front of the keynote hall at Moscone,\nlistening to Jonathan Schwartz's keynote. He just finished going\nthrough a blizzard of statistics. I don't have a good enough\nmemory, so I can't reproduce them accuratly here, but I was really\nimpressed. A bunch of numbers I hadn't heard. In particular, the\nexplosion in telephone handsets is astonishing. Worldwide,\nsomewhere around 20 million Java handsets per <i>month</i>.\n<b>wow</b> \n\n<p>Another amazing thing is the gaming performance. There was a\nlittle mess up in the demos, but if you get to see some of the new\ngames, they are very amazing. There's a new OpenGL binding, open\nsourced on java.net, that is just what the gaming folks want (it\nwas designed by a bunch of them).</p>\n\n",
