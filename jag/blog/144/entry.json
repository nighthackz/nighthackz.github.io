I'll be there for it, and for\n  the <a href=\"http://developers.sun.com/events/techdays/\" shape=\n  \"rect\">TechDays</a> event that follows.</li>\n\n  <li>As a special bonus, if you go to <a href=\n  \"http://www.netbeans.org/\" shape=\"rect\">netbeans.org</a>, you'll\n  find that you can get a <a href=\n  \"http://www.netbeans.org/community/articles/creator_promo.html\"\n  shape=\"rect\">free copy</a> of Java Studio Creator.</li>\n\n  <li>I won't be able to go to either NetBeans day (Nov 7th) or <a\n  href=\"http://jp.sun.com/javaone/\" shape=\"rect\">JavaOne Tokyo</a>\n  next week. They'll be great shows. The really bad part is that I\n  don't get to visit <a href=\n  \"http://www.jnto.go.jp/eng/RTG/RI/kanto/tokyo/akihabara/akihabara.html\"\n   shape=\"rect\">Akihabara</a>.</li>\n\n  <li>For all of my daily hacking, I've been living on <a href=\n  \"http://www.netbeans.org/community/releases/50/\" shape=\n  \"rect\">NetBeans 5</a> and it's getting sooo damn cool. Especially\n  the new UI builder. I've actually been living dangerously and\n  using the <a href=\n  \"http://www.netbeans.info/downloads/download.php?a=n&amp;p=1\"\n  shape=\"rect\">nightly builds</a>, but because of Java's <a href=\n  \"http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jag?entry=fault_containment_an_unsung_hero\"\n   shape=\"rect\">fault containment</a>, I have yet to get burned\n  (badly).</li>\n\n  <li>PS. Kudos to the <a href=\n  \"http://www.jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/first/jsr173/\"\n  shape=\"rect\">JSR173</a> crowd: I've been having a lot of fun with\n  it, despite the complexity of all the factories.</li>\n</ul>\n",
