He used his camera/java enabled mobile phone and took the\npicture and uploaded it with a MIDP application he's developing for\na Mobile Photo Blog. When I saw the picture, I almost fell out of\nmy chair laughing. The similarity is completely accidental. It is a\npicture of a bunch of \"bean bags\" being sold in the streets by\nlocal mobile merchants. Something very common in Brazil, it is what\nthey call \"Camel&#244;s\", or informal nomadic merchants.\n",
