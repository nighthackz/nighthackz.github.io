<td valign=top class=content><div class=entry><h1>Physics: out of the comfort zone</h1>
<img align=right src='Sledgehammer.png'>There's only about a week left to get entries submitted for the
t-shirt hurling contest, and they entries are coming in. But a
traditional problem continues to plague many of the submissions:
they're just not going to work! One of the goals of the T-Shirt
hurling contest is to get software geeks out of their technical
comfort zone and thinking about a totally different area. Building
an entry for the contest requires a decent grasp of basic physics,
mechanics and materials. Please, when you're working on your
entries (and please enter!) think hard about the mechanics. It's
often pretty subtle. 

<p>For example, Ron Smith, <a href=
"http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jag?entry=the_t_shirt_hurling_contest">last
years winner</a> ended up abandoning his original plan and building
something completely different. His original plan seemed really
simple and pretty plausible: build a large L shaped structure out
of a couple of beams with a pivot where the horizontal and vertical
parts join. The horizontal was 4-ish feet long, the vertical was
6-ish feet long. At the top of the vertical was a holder that the
t-shirt was placed in. To launch, take a sledgehammer and whack the
horizontal. Ought to work, right? It probably could, but it's
challenging to get the right materials. The key problem is that
when the sledgehammer hits there's an instantaneous force impulse
that puts huge stress at the joint between the horizontal and
vertical pieces. The device doesn't launch the shirt, it gets torn
apart, usually around the pivot. He tried all kinds of materials
joints and braces (at F), but none worked well enough.</p>

<p>He gave up on that plan, because the beast just kept ripping
itself apart. So he built a Trebuchet. He knew what he was doing
(unlike me, when I built one a couple of years before), so his
worked like a charm. In this case, his replan worked... But it
would still be interesting to see if someone could make it
work...</p>

<p>In contrast, the other two entries last year replanned to be
more cool... Their original plans were pretty solid, but they
feature-creeped into things that were pretty shakey.</p>
