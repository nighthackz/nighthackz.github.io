  "body" : "Back in 1990, the Green project was just getting started. This is\nwhere Java originated. Also in 1990 an arcade-style 2D game called\n<b>OIDS</b> was released on the Apple Macintosh. I developed a real\naddiction to it and spent many hours going back and forth between\nwriting the <i>java</i> (then <i>oak</i>) compiler/VM and playing\n<b>oids</b>. There's something deeply fascinating about gameplaying\nthat unlocks mental logjams. I'm sure that there are many PhD\nthesis topics here. Needless to say, I was thrilled to find that a\nnew release of <b>oids</b> came out for OS X just recently. It's no\ngreat visual experience compared to the mega 3D virtual universes\nof today. But just like in the movies, a compelling experience\nisn't defined just by its special effects.\n\n<p>I've never really been sucked into the mega 3D games (well,\nexcept for Commache: a helicopter warfare simulation game). All the\nfirst-person shooters in the Doom tradition never did it for me.\nLots of the folks around me got sucked in, but I never felt the\npull. Humans are wierd.</p>\n\n",
