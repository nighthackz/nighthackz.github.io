  "body" : "<br>\nWe've been gearing up for JavaOne08 for a while now. Advance\nregistration has finally opened. Inside the Java organization it\nhasn't risen to \"madness\" yet, but by April everyone will be\nworking 200% on it. The lineup of papers and technical sessions is\nlooking great. Lots of deep SE, EE, FX and mobility sessions. While\nnot many in the JavaOne crowd do realtime, the realtime group's\ndemos tend to be the best crowd pleasers (if only because they have\nthe greatest chance to maim). They've got a plan this year that\nwon't have the same capacity to maim as last years, but if Greg can\nget so many stepper motors and sensors to sync, it'll be\nmesmerizing.\n\n<p>There's a nice discount for early registration. Come join the\nfun!</p>\n\n",
