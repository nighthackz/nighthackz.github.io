<div class=entry><h1>Fun in Brazil</h1>
This week I'm in Brazil, visiting with developers. We're doing a
couple of days of technical seminars today and tomorrow in Sao
Paulo, then a couple more in Brasilia. The Brazilian developer
community is large, talented and enthusiastic. At the end of the
day today we had a little 10th birthday party for Java that got a
little out of control and turned into a <a href=

"rect">version of Carnival</a>, complete with serious dancing,
music, costumes and confetti. They take their technology
<i>very</i> seriously; <a href="http://www.ray.system.nom.br/"
shape="rect">Ray da Costa</a> even had the Java Logo <a href=
"http://nighthacks.com/roller/jag/BrazilJames_TattooGuy2.jpg"
shape="rect">tattooed</a> onto his arm. 

<p>I got to spend some time with the folks responsible for software
for their national medical system. They're deploying the second
generation of their system in Sao Paulo. It has some great new
features. One is a realtime surveilance system which allows them to
have diagnosis cause realtime triggers. For example, if a doctor
enters a diagnosis of menigitis, she is automatically prompted for
extra information and it all appears in realtime on maps in their
contageous disease center. They've got a great extended integrated
scheduling system that allows them to do non-local scheduling: for
example, if a patient needs to have a particular procedure or test
done, and the clinic they're at can't handle it right away, they
can schedule it in some nearby clinic. Very cool stuff.</p>

<p>Just saw a demo from the Brazilian tax service. Normally tax
agencies are pretty boring, but these folks have been doing very
cool stuff. For the last couple of years they've been using a Java
tax submission system and are running almost entirely paperless.
Their new thing for this year is that they've got a J2ME
application that runs on all the cell phones in Brazil (and they
have twice as many cellphones in the country as they have
households). This app allows folks to submit their tax forms from
their cell phone - no computer required. Quite a sophisticated
piece of cellphone hacking.</p>
