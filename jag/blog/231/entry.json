Yup. Guilty as\ncharged. There are only 24 hours in a day and we can't get around\nto everything, and back then we were putting most of our energy\ninto the enterprise APIs. Java is a community, not a product. So,\nPaul: I encourage you to join in and help make the imaging APIs\nbetter (or any other's that might trigger a rant). Collaboration is\na good thing.\n",
