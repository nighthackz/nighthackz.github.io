He seems to have misconstrued my weekend of\npleasant hacking as some great anti-open-source conspiracy and a\ndirect attack on his own project - which is also an RSS feed\nreader. I have to admit that I was completely unaware of his\nefforts, and I'm sure that his is a most excellent piece of work,\nunlike the quick hack I slapped together. Just because others have\ndone RSS feed readers (or any other kind of software), does not\nmean that suddenly no one else has the right to do the same. I hack\nbecause it's fun. I picked that topic because it was interesting.\nIt's sad that the good Mr Munsch feels stepped on. I did not intend\nthat. He does need to lighten up and get a sense of humour. Life's\nto short to spend it wound up in a knot of needless fury.\n",
