Another <a href=\n\"http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Laozi\">step in the journey</a>: \n\n<blockquote>\n  The congregation at St Lawrence Jewry in the City of London\n  raised their mobiles and iPods above their heads and Canon\n  Parrott raised his voice to the heavens to address the Lord God\n  of all Creation. \"May our tongues be gentle, our e-mails be\n  simple and our websites be accessible,\" he said. \n\n  <p>Great efforts have been made to modernise the Church of\n  England, but its liturgy dates from before the arrival of the\n  Nokia 6310, and until yesterday, none had been brave enough to\n  adapt its ceremonies to address the modern mysteries of 3G\n  network coverage, iPhone apps and variable battery life.</p>\n</blockquote><br clear=\"both\">\n\n",
