  "body" : "I did the <a href=\n\"http://java.sun.com/javaone/sf/sessions/general/index.jsp#GS2\">Toy\nShow</a> on the last day of JavaOne, intending to write a wrap-up\narticle immediatly. But It's amazing how <a href=\n\"http://www.bartleby.com/119/1.html\">way leads on to way</a>. I got\noff the stage at 10:30 and headed home where I had a houseful of\nrelatives visiting for Mother's Day. When I got home I found that\nmy neice had broken her ankle (by stepping on a tennis ball -\nwhodathunk?) just moments before I arrived, so I ended up heading\noff to the ER at Stanford where I spent the next 6 hours. Joy. The\nrest of the weekend was really nice. \n\n<p>Back to the <a href=\n\"http://www.sun.com/featured-articles/2007-0514/feature/index.jsp\">Toy\nShow</a>... If you weren't there, you should <a href=\n\"http://java.sun.com/javaone/sf/sessions/general/index.jsp#GS2\">watch\nthe videos</a>. The tail end of the session was devoted to devices\nthat aren't important to many JavaOne attendees in their normal\nsoftware development role, but they sure do stretch the mind. For\nexample, the <a href=\"http://sonia.etsmtl.ca/en/\">SONIA autonomous\nunderwater vehicle</a> was a great example of a bunch of students\nhaving a huge amount of fun doing something quite interesting. I\nespecially liked their timeline that showed the correlation between\ntheir contest ranking and their adoption of Java.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, there was a huge amount of interesting stuff at\nJavaOne. <a href=\"http://openjdk.java.net/\">OpenJDK</a>, <a href=\n\"https://openjfx.dev.java.net/\">JavaFX scripting</a>, <a href=\n\"http://wiki.glassfish.java.net/gfwiki/Wiki.jsp?page=PlanForGlassFishV3\">Glassfish\nV3</a>, <a href=\n\"http://www.netbeans.org/community/releases/60/index.html\">NetBeans\n6</a>, <a href=\"http://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/\">NASA World\nWind</a>, <a href=\n\"http://weblogs.java.net/blog/chet/archive/2007/05/consumer_jre_le.html\">Consumer\nJRE</a>, <a href=\n\"http://developers.sun.com/learning/javaoneonline/j1sessn.jsp?sessn=TS-0887&amp;yr=2007&amp;track=1\">BDJ</a>,\n<a href=\n\"http://www.jasperpotts.com/blog/2007/05/iris-java-one-demo/\">applet\nfun everywhere</a>, and some cool <a href=\n\"http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/realtime/index.jsp\">realtime</a>\nrobotics demos - and a whole lot more.</p>\n\n<p>I don't think I've ever been through such a hectic JavaOne, or\nended up with such a long to-do list (Mostly JavaFX stuff...). Much\nfun to com!</p>\n\n",
