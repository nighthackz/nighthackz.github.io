The image shows the\nlatest data from the shakedown cruise. There are some data dropouts\n(don't ask!) but if you look closely at the <a href=\n\"http://data.liquidr.com/erddap/tabledap/DatawellMOSE.graph\">data</a>\nyou'll see some 6 meter (20ish feet!) waves on the way down to\nMonterey. Their course through the ocean didn't even wiggle. There\nare supposed to be some storms coming up this week, should be\nentertaining. The 'bots will probably just say \"<a href=\n\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/yippee\">Yippee!</a>\"\n",
