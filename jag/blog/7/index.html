<b>If the bug isn't where you're looking, you're probably looking
in the wrong place</b> Seems pretty obvious, but I get nailed by it
all the time: I get some preconcieved notion of where the problem
is, and then I focus there to the exclusion of looking at other
possibilities.

<p>Readers of this blog may be wondering why It's been so long
since I last added an entry. I write this blog using my own tool,
which you can find at bloged.dev.java.net. It recently developed a
problem that took me a long time to resolve - and it was a classic
case of looking in the wrong place. Of course, the real reason that
it took a long time to resolve is that I tried to write a blog
entry with the new version, but that failed; then I couldn't look
at the problem right away because there was other stuff I had to
rush off to. It's a real problem when you have to debug things in
15 minute sessions, once a week.</p>

<p>Atsuhiko Yamanaka had been doing some excellent work adding
security features to the ssh web site access facilities. He did a
putback, I brought it over, rebuilt... <b>boom</b> it didn't work.
And it didn't work in a perplexingly silent way. I was pretty
surprised since Atsuhiko has done flawless work and I totally
expected his stuff to fly. But this didn't - the problem was
<i>clearly</i> in the code he had put back so that's where I was
looking. But look as I might, I couldn't find the problem. I'll
spare you the intervening gory details about the stupidly fruitless
search for a problem in his perfect code. In the end it turned out
to be totally elsewhere: I had leapt from the bringover/build/boom
correllation to believing I knew where the bug was. But there were
other things going on in the world. In this case, it was a
configuration change in another part of the universe. I only found
out about it when I <tt>ssh</tt>ed to the server, and that failed
too..... A few minutes later, problem solved.  <i>Duh</i></p>
