  "body" : "I had to have some unexpected surgery done on Monday. Nothing huge,\nbut they've got me on tasty drugs and my jaw is a mess - talking is\nhard. I remembered to tell the DOAG and DEVOXX organizers that I\nwasn't going to be able to show up for their events, but I forgot\nto tell the SVJUG organizers until just a few minutes ago. Sorry\nfolks. It's going to be a few weeks until I can do much.\n",
