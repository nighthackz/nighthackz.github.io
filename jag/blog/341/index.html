<img align=right src='Firestorm.jpg'>The last couple of days have been quite an entertaining firestorm
of press and blog-o-sphere commentary. Lots of questions were
brought up that give me a bottomless supply of blog topics. I hope
I have the common sense to not write on most of them :-) 

<p>But there are some topics I feel I should briefly say something
about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In Sun's early history, we didn't think much of patents.
  While there's a kernel of good sense in the reasoning for
  patents, the system itself has gotten goofy. Sun didn't file many
  patents initially. But then we got sued by IBM for violating the
  "RISC patent" - a patent that essentially said "if you make
  something simpler, it'll go faster". Seemed like a blindingly
  obvious notion that shouldn't have been patentable, but we got
  sued, and lost. The penalty was <i>huge</i>. Nearly put us out of
  business. We survived, but to help protect us from future suits
  we went on a patenting binge. Even though we had a basic distaste
  for patents, the game is what it is, and patents are essential in
  modern corporations, if only as a defensive measure. There was
  even an unofficial competition to see who could get the goofiest
  patent through the system. <a href=
  "http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=44&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=%22gosling,+james%22.INNM.&amp;OS=IN/%22gosling,+james%22&amp;RS=IN/%22gosling,+james%22">My
  entry</a> wasn't nearly the goofiest.</li>

  <li>
    Sun got a lot of heat for not going full open source early on
    (and there's a lot of disagreement over what "full open source"
    would mean... GPL? Apache?). But freedom is a funny concept.
    It's often a function of point of view: freedom for one could
    restrict the freedom of another. The freedom we were most
    concerned about was the freedom of software developers to run
    their applications on whatever OS or hardware they wanted. In
    opposition to that, the platform providers wanted the freedom
    to make their platforms as sticky as possible. Microsoft was
    the poster child for stickiness: they signed a contract saying
    that they'd support interoperability. Shortly thereafter they
    broke that promise by making it the case that if Java programs
    were developed on Windows, they wouldn't run anywhere else, so
    we took them to court and won. We were pretty careful about
    enforcing interoperability on desktops and servers. As an
    interesting aside, that commitment to interoperability is why
    Apple dislikes Java. Having OS X apps run on Linux or Windows
    doesn't make them happy. Apple wants to <a href=
    "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117731/quotes?qt0455855">add your
    technological distinctiveness to their own</a>. 

    <p>When it came to cellphones and JavaME, we weren't as able
    and successful at achieving interoperability. There were a lot
    of factors, but it all added up to pain for developers and a
    chilling of the software market. When Google came to us with
    their thoughts on cellphones, one of their core principles was
    making the platform free to handset providers. They had very
    weak notions of interoperability, which, given our history, we
    strongly objected to. Android has pretty much played out the
    way that we feared: there is enough fragmentation among Android
    handsets to significantly restrict the freedom of software
    developers.</p>
  </li>

  <li>Money was, of course, also an issue between Sun and Google.
  We wanted some compensation for the large amount we would be
  spending on engineering. Google did have a financial model that
  benefited themselves (that they weren't about to share). They
  were partly planning on revenue from advertising, but mostly they
  wanted to disrupt Apple's trajectory, and Apple's expected entry
  into advertising. If mobile devices take over as the computing
  platform for consumers, then Google's advertising channel, and
  the heart of its revenue, gets gutted. It doesn't take much of a
  crystal ball to see where Apple is going, and it's not a pretty
  picture for Google or anyone else.</li>

  <li>Don't interpret any of my comments as support for Oracle's
  suit. There are no guiltless parties with white hats in this
  little drama. This skirmish isn't much about patents or
  principles or programming languages. The suit is far more about
  ego, money and power.</li>

  <li>It's a sad comment on the morality of large modern software
  companies that Microsoft, while I don't think they've gotten any
  better since Sun sued them, probably has the high ground.</li>
</ul>It's tough living in a world of Borg-wanna-be's.
