<div class=entry><h1>Equations and Methods</h1>
<blockquote>
  Instead of my usual whining, I thought I'd write a few blog
  entries that are more technical. I've been playing with a lot of
  stuff lately. Lots of threads of ideas to play with. Mostly just
  fragments, not adding up to much. This is the start of one thread
  that's been wandering through my head for years. I'll need to add
  several more blog entries before this one even starts to make
  sense.
</blockquote>Ignore computer science for a moment, including
everything you know about programming languages. Think back to the
math courses you took in school. There are many things in that
space that are programming-language-ish, but missing from
programming languages. Consider Newton's Method: 

<blockquote>
  <h2><a href=

  method</a>, from Wikipedia:</h2>
  In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis"
  title="Numerical analysis">numerical analysis</a>, <b>Newton's
  method</b> (also known as the <b>Newton-Raphson method</b>),
  named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton"
  title="Isaac Newton">Isaac Newton</a> and <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Raphson" title=
  "Joseph Raphson">Joseph Raphson</a>, is a method for finding
  successively better approximations to the zeroes (or <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_of_a_function" title=
  "Root of a function">roots</a>) of a <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number" title=
  "Real number">real</a>-valued <a href=
  "http://nighthacks.com/wiki/Function_(mathematics)" title=
  "Function (mathematics)">function</a>. The algorithm is first in

  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halley%27s_method" title=
  "Halley's method">Halley's method</a>.<br>
  <br>
   

  <p style="font-weight: bold">The Newton-Raphson method in one
  variable:</p>

  <p>Given a function <i>&#402;</i>(<i>x</i>) and its <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative" title=
  "Derivative">derivative</a> <i>&#402;</i>'(<i>x</i>), we begin
  with a first guess <i>x</i><sub>0</sub>. Provided the function is
  reasonably well-behaved a better approximation
  <i>x</i><sub>1</sub> is</p>

  <p>Geometrically, x<sub>1</sub> is the intersection point of the
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_line" title=
  "Tangent line" class="mw-redirect">tangent line</a> to the graph
  of f, with the x-axis. The process is repeated until a
  sufficiently accurate value is reached:</p>
</blockquote>So what is Newton's Method? It's kind of like a
function that takes two functions as parameters (f(x) and f'(x)).
But the second parameter is should really be derived from the
first. f'(x) can be approximated by a little numerical trickery,
but it's a numerically dicey thing to do. One of the big drawbacks
with closures and function pointers is that you just get to execute
the function. You can't do any introspection. This is one of those
times where I miss Lisp macros: the ability to rip open a function
and do wild things like symbolic differentiation was wonderful. My
PhD thesis project was filled with such hackery. 

<p>Instead, people rarely code Newton's method in the abstract.
They usually apply it on paper to some concrete function, like
f(x)=x<sup>2</sup>-V (finding the zeros computes sqrt(V)). The code
you end up with looks like this:</p>

<table align="center">
  <tr>
    <td>
<pre>
public double xyzzy(final double v) {
        long lt = Double.doubleToRawLongBits(v);
        double t = Double.longBitsToDouble((((1L&lt;&lt;52)-1)|(1L&lt;&lt;63)) &amp; lt |
                  (((long)((((int)((lt&gt;&gt;52)&amp;((1&lt;&lt;11)-1))-1023)&gt;&gt;1)+1023))&lt;&lt;52));
        t = 0.5*(t+v/t);
        t = 0.5*(t+v/t);
        t = 0.5*(t+v/t);
        t = 0.5*(t+v/t);
        t = 0.5*(t+v/t);
        return t;
 }
</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>(This actually works, it's almost good to the last bit) If
someone emailed this code fragment to you, I'll bet that you'd be
hard pressed to figure out what it does. The 5x loop unrolling
might be a good hint, but the long bit-bashing expression at the
beginning is pretty opaque. Both f(x) and Newton's method have
become totally obscure. The code is hard to fix or modify. It's
very brittle. 

<p>This isn't just a specific rant about Newton's method. There are
lots of other "method"s that map from some problem to a piece of
code for computing the result. The domains that are particularly
problematic these days are the zillion techniques for using
multicore machines and clusters of them to solve some problem.
Straightforward solutions get twisted and pulled as they're mapped
to frameworks like MPI or Hadoop until they're totally obscure and
wound into a ton of boilerplate.</p>

<p>More on this another day...</p>
