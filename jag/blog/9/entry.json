  "body" : "I've spent Thursday and Friday this week in Beijing giving talks\nabout Java. There's a very large and vibrant community of Java\ndevelopers in China. It's been great meeting so many interesting\nand talented people who are doing great work. China is an\nincredibly dynamic and growing country.\n\n<p>After all that, I got to be a tourist for a while. This is a\npicture of me on top of one of the many guard towers on the Great\nWall of China. I actually climbed to the top of the highest tower\nin the background. I had been somewhat puzzled about why folks\ntalked about \"climbing\" the great wall: I had this naive view that\nyou got to the top of the wall and then walked along it. But\nwalking along it is truly hard: the wall goes up some very steep\nand high mountain slopes. It's quite an impressive piece of\nwork.</p>\n\n",
