  "body" : "<p style=\"text-align: left\">I made up some cheesy certificates to\ngive to the winners of the TSHC contest. I was trying to come up\nwith a catchy slogan to put at the top of the certificate, but\neverything I could think of was boring. But it occurred to me that\nboring stuff sounds cool if it's in Latin. But I don't know Latin,\nso I asked Guy Steele (who knows Latin) if he could come up with\nanything. Here's his reply:</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Yeah, I studied Latin for six years.\nThe principal difficulty is that the right word for \"hurler\" is\n\"jaculator\", which is uncomfortably close to English \"ejaculator\"\n(which, of course, is etymologically no coincidence). Also, if your\nwinner is a female, it ought to be \"jaculatrix\", which is a\nlegitimate Latin word for \"female hurler\" or \"spearwoman\", but\nthanks to the one-time co-opting of Latin for sexual euphemism, I\nfear that \"jaculatrix\" will be misinterpreted by most moderns as\nsome sort of transgendered dominatrix or something.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">How about something like \"athleta\ntunicis fortissimus\", which translates as \"strongest winner of a\nprize with tunics\"? (I figured \"tunic\" is about as close as we can\nhope to get to \"T-shirt\".) The word \"athleta\" meant \"winner of a\nprize\", which has evolved into the modern \"athlete\". Or, for real\nflavor,</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">ATHLETA TVNICIS FORTISSIMVS</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">in nice, classic, chiseled Roman\nlettering. (By the way, \"athleta\", a borrowing from Greek, is\nconsidered to be a masculine noun in Latin, despite the \"-a\"\nending, so the \"-us\" ending on \"fortissimus\" really does match it\nproperly. The \"-is\" on \"tunicis\" indicates the ablative case.)</p>\n\n",
