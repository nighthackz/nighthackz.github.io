<p style="text-align: left">I made up some cheesy certificates to
give to the winners of the TSHC contest. I was trying to come up
with a catchy slogan to put at the top of the certificate, but
everything I could think of was boring. But it occurred to me that
boring stuff sounds cool if it's in Latin. But I don't know Latin,
so I asked Guy Steele (who knows Latin) if he could come up with
anything. Here's his reply:</p>

<p style="text-align: left">Yeah, I studied Latin for six years.
The principal difficulty is that the right word for "hurler" is
"jaculator", which is uncomfortably close to English "ejaculator"
(which, of course, is etymologically no coincidence). Also, if your
winner is a female, it ought to be "jaculatrix", which is a
legitimate Latin word for "female hurler" or "spearwoman", but
thanks to the one-time co-opting of Latin for sexual euphemism, I
fear that "jaculatrix" will be misinterpreted by most moderns as
some sort of transgendered dominatrix or something.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">How about something like "athleta
tunicis fortissimus", which translates as "strongest winner of a
prize with tunics"? (I figured "tunic" is about as close as we can
hope to get to "T-shirt".) The word "athleta" meant "winner of a
prize", which has evolved into the modern "athlete". Or, for real
flavor,</p>

<p style="text-align: center">ATHLETA TVNICIS FORTISSIMVS</p>

<p style="text-align: left">in nice, classic, chiseled Roman
lettering. (By the way, "athleta", a borrowing from Greek, is
considered to be a masculine noun in Latin, despite the "-a"
ending, so the "-us" ending on "fortissimus" really does match it
properly. The "-is" on "tunicis" indicates the ablative case.)</p>
