  "body" : "Earlier this evening I spent a couple of hours at the \"Fireside\nchat\". We've been holding this for the last several years the night\nbefore JavaOne kicks off. It's mostly an open mike Q&amp;A session\nwith a collection of Sun folks in the hot seats answering questions\nfrom the audience. The thing I love about it is that it really is a\ntwo way exchange: we get to answer peoples questions, but in return\nwe get a picture of what is on people's minds.\n\n<p>After that I had dinner with a few folks who had won the \"Helix\"\ncontest. There should be an article about it in the JavaOne\nnewsletter or website in the next day or two. It's always fun to\ngab with geeks having fun building cool stuff.</p>\n\n",
