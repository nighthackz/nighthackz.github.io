<img align=right src='greenfoot-icon-128.png'>I've been talking about <a href="http://bluej.org">BlueJ</a> and <a
href="http://greenfoot.org">Greenfoot</a> for years. They're tools
for teaching people to program who have never programmed before.
BlueJ is a special-purpose IDE that's all about teaching. Greenfoot
is a collection of scenarios layered on BlueJ that provide the
framework for assignments based on simulations and games. They each
have books (<a href=
"http://www.amazon.com/Objects-First-Java-Practical-Introduction/dp/0136060862">bluej</a>
and <a href=
"http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Programming-Greenfoot-Object-Oriented-Simulations/dp/0136037534">greenfoot</a>)
that are designed for classroom or independent use. 

<p>It's summer and one of the items on my to-do list has been to
teach my youngest daughter how to program. I was planning to spend
some time in the evenings with her. But before I could get started,
my wife handed her a copy of the <a href=
"http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Programming-Greenfoot-Object-Oriented-Simulations/dp/0136037534">greenfoot
book</a> and my daughter started reading. While I was off at work
she downloaded and installed the IDE and started using the book the
way it was intended: reading it cover-to-cover doing the exercises
as they came along. I've helped her a couple of times when she got
stuck, but mostly she's just plowed ahead on her own and is having
a great time. The exercises are all very visual and engaging.
Greenfoot makes it <i>fun</i> to learn programming. It starts out
with very <a href=
"http://el.media.mit.edu/logo-foundation/logo/programming.html">logo-ish</a>
exercises (moving a wombat around via method calls to find food),
then automating the characters so that they can find their own
food, and progressing to a variety of video games. The scenarios
really absorb kids.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone on the <a href=
"http://greenfoot.org/about/contributors.html">GreenFoot team</a>!!
You've made a difference in at least one young girl's life.</p>
