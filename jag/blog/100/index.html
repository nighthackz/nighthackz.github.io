<td valign=top class=content><div class=entry><h1>Finally, the end of a great week</h1>
<img align=right src='Image27-small.jpeg'>I'm finally back home connected to the net again. It's been a great
week. Today started with Scott McNealy's keynote, which was
entertaining (as always). He gave out several awards for the best
Java projects: all well deserved, and very cool. I don't remember
them all, but they included the JPL folks, the Brazilian Healthcare
project, the navigation system from Jentro, a very cool Nokia
handset; and a special award for Thor Norbye for his incredibly
studly performance during a demo on Wednesday where everything
crashed (it was the back end database!) and he put it back together
in real time. Iron Chef comes to hacking.

<p>The picture at the left is of me with the winners of the Urban
Adventure contest. It was a scavenger hunt that covered a lot of
San Francisco. About 100 teams competed. Many were groups of
friends, but this team was four people who had never met before,
but who worked together extremely well. They turned out to have
complementary skills and compatible personalities. Quite a piece of
luck! It sounds like the whole Urban Adventure was a lot of fun for
everyone. In general, JavaOne is end-to-end compressed learning and
parties. Totally exhausting.</p>

<p>If I had to pick one highlight of the whole week, it would be
that I noticed that everyone was smiling. Last year, there was a
general feeling of gloom. It wasn't about Java at all, just a
general gloom about life, the universe, and everything. This year
was very upbeat and charged. And unlike the bubble years, when I'd
ask folks what they were doing, the answers made sense. No fluffy
concepts. No goofball math. Just real products. Real business
plans. Real success.</p>

<p><i>Very</i>, <b>very</b>, cool.</p>

<p>And the best part is that I get to sleep in tomorrow...</p>
