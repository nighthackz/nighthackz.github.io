<a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring">Refactoring</a>
covers a broad swath of techniques to make code cleaner, more
reliable, more maintainable, ... But sometimes, these attributes
fight against each other. The usual attribute that causes trouble
is "more performance". For example, consider factoring out a
loop-invarient boolean: 
<pre>
for(....) {
    ...
    if(b) A;
    else B;
    ....
}
</pre>
when b is loop-invarient, this can become: 
<pre>
if(b)
    for(...) {
        ...
        A;
        ...
    } else
    for(...) {
        ...
        B;
        ...
    }
</pre>
Depending on a wide variety of factors, this can be faster.
Although it might be slower. Careful benchmarking is required :-) 

<p>It is certainly less maintainable and less clear. When you see a
pice of code that is the result of such a transformation, it's
often difficult to tell that the two loops are related. If a bug is
found in any of the replicated pieces of code, it has to be fixed
in *both* places. Testing gets more complicated because the
replicated code paths have to be independently (and somewhat
redundantly) tested. To compound the problem, if you have (for
example) multiple loop-invarient booleans, the code expansion is
exponential (!!) in the number of factored-out booleans. This can
get pretty insane pretty fast. I've seen instances where folks have
tried to be clean about these transformations by clever use of C
macros, but this can get really messy. And the code explosion can
be dramatic: I got pulled into this problem years ago when someone
checked a new line-drawing routine into the SunOS kernel (that's
what Solaris was called before the SVr4 merge) that was bigger than
the whole rest of the kernel. But it was fast. I got the job of
fixing it :-(</p>

<p>For most people, this class of transformations should be avoided
like the plague they are. But for folks like me who all too often
need to do intense tuning, they are necessary. Can they be made
cleaner? It's a pity that refactoring is viewed purely as something
done in an IDE. Sometimes, you can do cool things if the
refactoring is expressed in the language. But that's another blog
entry.</p>

    <td>It's "build season" for the <a href=
    "http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc/default.aspx?id=966">FIRST
    Robotics Competition</a>. A couple of years ago Sun worked with
    FIRST to put a <a href=
    "http://first.wpi.edu/FRC/frcjava.html">JavaVM on the
    industrial automation controller that they use</a>. Before
    this, programming the robots was almost impossible. The contest
    turned into all-mechanical projects, with very little software.
    With the JVM (and the ability to debug running robots) they've
    become much easier to program. This year I'm mentoring the team
    at my younger daughter's school. I'm having a great time
    helping these kids write control software that works with a
    pile of motors and sensors. Can't wait to see it all work.</td>

    <td>The RSA conference is in town, which was fun to wander
    through. It's hard to believe that so many companies making
    firewalls can succeed. The hard part for me is that I've become
    something of a magnet for former sun customers and partners to
    tell their tales of the <a href=
    "http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/shenanigans">shenanigans</a>
    that the Oracle sales force engages in to trap customers. One
    got caught in a weird shell game where the oracle team was
    working hard chasing him around town to prevent him from
    talking to another vendor - physically interposing themselves
    between the vendor and the customer. As frustrating and
    pathetic as the stories are, I find them easy to manage by
    treating them as humor. It is outrageously goofy the stunts
    that get pulled (although the 5x to 20x price increases often
    forced on customers are infuriating - talk to anyone
    "upgrading" from Sun Identity Manager).</td>
