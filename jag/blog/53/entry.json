  "body" : "Yesterday was mad. Today has been mad. All in a good way. Getting\nfresh stuff out on my blog has just been too hard. So many\nconversations with so many people. So much excitement. I can't walk\n10 steps without someone cornering me to tell me about some cool\nthing they're working on. Exhausting and wonderful. So much energy.\n\n<p>My last \"official\" event yesterday was Canadian Night, where a\nbunch of Canadians got together to talk. Garry Rasko has been\norganizing these for several years. The high point for me was that\nhe imported a sixpack of Big Rock Beer just for me, and by then, I\nneeded it. After Canadian Night I headed off with my brother-in-law\nto burn the beer out of my system with some tasty Hunan food.</p>\n\n<p>Needless to say, I haven't had anywhere near enough time to do\nprep for my keynote tomorrow. It'll be very improv, which will\ndrive the stage crew mad. :-)</p>\n\n",
