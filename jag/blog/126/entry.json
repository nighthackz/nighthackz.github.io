They got a pile of old\nvideo clips and photos, and they interviewed many of the people\nI've worked with and for. And they got my wife and daughters in on\nthe scheme to contribute their own segments. I don't know how they\nmanaged to keep it a secret (particularly my 7 year old), but they\ndid. \n\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Thanks everyone!</p>\n\n",
