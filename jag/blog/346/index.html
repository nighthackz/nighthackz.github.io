<div class=entry><h1>JavaOne was fun...</h1>
...in a twisted way. I didn't attend any of the sessions, I just
wandered around in an <a href=
"http://www.cafepress.com/OrcOmit.464745320">obnoxious t-shirt</a>.
JavaOne attendees were friendly and chatty. OpenWorld attendees
were confused. Oracle employees behaved like there was an invisible
force field around me: they did their best to keep their distance.
I didn't run into anyone else wearing one of the shirts, but I
talked to lots who said they had them but couldn't bring themselves
to wear them. Apparently one exhibitor had a box of "Just Free It"
shirts that they started to give away at their booth, until the
thought police descended. Mostly I went to bars and receptions and
had chats with reporters. Lots of entertaining conversations. 

<p>Most of the folks I talked to who attended the keynotes were
struck by how little of substance was said by anyone. The LPOD's
180&#186; turn on the topic of cloud's was pretty amusing. The
generally wooden presentation style of most of the senior
executives was also amusing. Several folks commented on the body
language of the audience. Mostly apathetic, but for Mark Hurd's
talk, it was pretty tense.</p>

<p>At one point I was chatting with a crowd of folks from HP. Their
general consensus was "Oracle's gain is our gain" :-) He's famous
for over-the-top cost cutting. One person I know well worked in the
HP HQ building, where Hurd's office was. Like most offices, they
had break rooms sprinkled around the buildings with coffee machines
in them. He discontinued the coffee service, but he didn't just set
the coffee supply budget to zero: plumbers actually came out and
removed the coffee machines and the plumbing to them (which had to
be expensive). This caused all employees to have to hike over to
the cafeteria whenever they needed a cup of coffee. Huge loss in
productivity. Nutty. One of the formerly Sun, now Oracle, folks
asked roughly "Larry hired Hurd, saying that fudging his expense
report wasn't grounds for dismissal; does that mean that all Oracle
employees now have permission to fudge their expense reports?".</p>

<p>One of the more entertaining lines I heard was at a cocktail
party held by some 3rd party partners. "We love the Oracle sales
force!" (what?? surprised look on my face) "They're so nasty, their
prices are so high, and their tactics so obnoxious that all we have
to do is be credible and treat the customer with respect - then the
deal is ours!". Yow.</p>
