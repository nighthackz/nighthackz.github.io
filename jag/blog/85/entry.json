  "body" : "Several people reading this blog have asked about <a href=\n\"http://cloudline.org\" shape=\"rect\">cloudline.org</a>, the website\nthey get redirected to if they go to norquay.com rather than\nnorquay.com/blog. Norquay.com is my personal website. I used to\nhost and run a website here for my friends Charlie Russell and\nMaureen Enns who study bears. It did very well, so now they're\nrunning the website themselves. I encourage you to wander around\nit. It's essentially a weblog with pictures from a couple of people\nwho spend their lives with grizzly bears.. It got started long\nbefore blogging became so fashionable. Quite a different\nperspective on life than the usual high tech world. Balance.\n\n<p>[ This entry made sense when my blog was hosted on my personal\nweb site; but now that it's moved, this entry seems a little odd.\nBut cloudline.org is still very cool ]</p>\n\n",
