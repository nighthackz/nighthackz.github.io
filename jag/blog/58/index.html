<div class=entry><h1>Finally, my turn at a keynote</h1>
This is a picture of folks filing in to the keynote hall for the
last keynote of JavaOne, the one where I had to do some real work.
After last nights rehearsals, we (mostly) knew what were were
doing, but a lot of the plan was "Ad Lib". I'm not real good at
reading teleprompters.

<p>I didn't do much talking. There were zero slides for the whole
session (who has time to prepare?!). Three tool demos followed by
three device demos. The collaboration facilities in the upcoming
version of Java Studio Enterprise got big cheers from the audience.
The realtime demo showed a scaleable fault-tolerant VM that
balanced an inverted pendulum despite wild loads on the systems,
software and hardware failures. PsiNaptics showed a cool
JINI-on-bluetooth device that was amazingly small. And Simon Ritter
had a great wearable rig.</p>

<p>The "Great Debate" was pretty entertaining. I won't try to
represent what happened there, I leave that to someone else to
write up, but it surfaced a lot of complex and contradictory
concerns.</p>

<p>The E ticket item was, of course, the finals of the T-Shirt
launch. Today's team was the caffeinators with their calibrated
crossbow. When we held the vote, which was done with an applause
meter, the Cyclists came in first, followed by Team Visicomp (the
nitro cannon), followed by the Caffeinators. Great fun.</p>

<p>I'd like to thank everyone. The folks in the t-shirt contest.
The crew that ran the whole show. All the folks at Sun who have
poured so much energy into the show. All the partners that joined
in... And especially all of the attendees: JavaOne and the whole
Java community are built on your energy and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Thanks. Now I'm off to a beach!</p>
