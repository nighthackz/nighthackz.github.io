<div class=entry><h1>Java Urban Performance Legends</h1>
<img align=right src='2005_10_09_14-07-58-075_n3.small.png'>There's a great thread on Slashdot titled <a href=
"http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/10/09/1259246&amp;tid=108&amp;tid=8"
 shape="rect">Java Urban Performance Legends</a>. It's mostly
thrashing out urban performance legends in garbage collection, but
you can find them all over the place. Modern Java VMs really are
quite fast, often beating C and C++ in all sorts of benchmarks.
Another common urban performance legend is that "Java must be slow
because there's no way to turn off subscript checking": this one is
completely false because all modern JVMs have optimizers that do a
great job of eliminating subscript checking. 

<p style="text-align: left">There was a funny incident at a recent
developer event where some folks had a booth where they where
demo-ing a high end industrial strength C compiler and had a
benchmark that they had transliterated into Java. They were
comparing their compiler to GCC and Java. GCC was running at about
2/3 the performance of this high end compiler; the Java version was
running at about 2/3 the performance of the GCC version. Folks were
gathered around the booth and someone noticed that the script they
were using to run the Java version didn't have optimisation turned
on. A few seconds with vi to add the "-server" switch and Java's
performance jumped up to match the fancy C compiler. This got the
pro-GCC crowd all excited, so a bunch of them started fiddling with
its command line switches. They got a bit of improvement, but not
much (the original selection had been pretty good).</p>

<p style="text-align: left">The one place where Java does have a
legitimate remaining performance issue is startup time. But these
days it's down small enough to where anything that runs more than a
few seconds has a hard time noticing it. Most startup time in
modern Java apps goes to the app itself, not the VM.</p>
