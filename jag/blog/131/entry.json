There is a large\nsection on fascinating catapult-like devices that would make great\nideas for the t-shirt hurling contest. In particular, the rotary\ndevice in this picture bears a certain resemblance to the gizmo\nthat the Australians put together. There's nothing in the picture\nthat looks like a credible release mechanism. It would be awfully\nhard to aim. I doubt that it was ever actually built. Maybe the\nAustralians can go back in time and give Leonardo some solinoids? \n\n<p>There was also this interesting <a href=\n\"http://blogs.sun.com/roller/resources/jag/LeonardoTrebuchet3.mov\"\nshape=\"rect\">variation on the trebuchet</a>. Rather than having the\ncounterweight mounted pendulum-like on the end of the arm, it is\ndangling from a wheel. The interesting effect this has is that the\nforce accellerating the rotation of the arm does not diminish as\nthe arm approaches vertical. Could be a fascinating tweak to\nexplore. [ a note about the movie: I copied the drawing from <i>The\nComplete Paintings and Drawings</i>, <a href=\n\"http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/main.html\" shape=\n\"rect\">Photoshop</a>ed it into layers, built a little model using\n<a href=\"http://www.newtek.com/lightwave/\" shape=\n\"rect\">Lightwave</a> ]</p>\n\n",
