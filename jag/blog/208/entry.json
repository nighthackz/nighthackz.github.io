  "body" : "We won't be holding the t-shirt hurling contest at JavaOne this\nyear. I should have done all of the prep and announcements a couple\nof months ago, but I was out sick and mostly unconscious. I've been\nback at work for a few weeks and it's become clear that the time is\ntoo short and life is <i>way</i> too hectic for me to do it\nproperly. There's also the problem that we've got a pile of other\ncontests happening, so JavaOne was getting pretty crowded. These\nother contests should be fantastic and will allow more people to\nparticipate. The early work on them is looking great.\n",
