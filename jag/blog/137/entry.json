We had a series of in-depth talks on a\nbroad range of issues in Netbeans. The fellow who was supposed to\nbe the moderator and first speaker had flight troubles\n(thunderstorms at Narita) that delayed him by a day so I ended up\ndoing double duty: his parts and mine. It was a very good crowd. \n\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">I also did a 2 hour chat session with\ndevelopers all over China that was run by <a href=\n\"http://csdn.net/\" shape=\"rect\">CSDN</a>.</p>\n\n",
