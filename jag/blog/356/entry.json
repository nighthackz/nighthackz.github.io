  "body" : "Wow. This morning's <a href=\n\"http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/11/12openjdk.html\">press\nrelease</a> from Apple &amp; Oracle is incredibly encouraging.\nTalks with Apple on this topic have gone on for many years, it's\ngreat to see a positive move actually happen. The two questions\nthat only time can answer are: will both parties actually deliver?\nand how will this work with Apple's software update center? (That\nhad been one of the sticking points in the past: they didn't want\nto have Java auto-update from some mechanism outside their software\nupdate center, and they didn't want an outsider delivering code via\ntheir update center).\n",
