  "body" : "The JavaCard team have been cranking away. Development on the 3.0\nversion is finally (almost) finished, and it's pretty amazing. Java\nCard 3 is available in two Editions. \n\n<dl>\n  <dt>Classic Edition</dt>\n\n  <dd>This is the same as Java Card 2 with some enhancements/bug\n  fixes. It is almost 10 years young and is the most popular\n  platform for the SIM and ID markets.</dd>\n\n  <dt>Connected Edition</dt>\n\n  <dd>\n    This is <b><i>the</i></b> next generation Java Card technology:\n    \n\n    <ul>\n      <li>JDK6 Compatible VM: Except for floats, it support class\n      file version 50.</li>\n\n      <li>Full Java Language support: Java Card 2 has restrictions\n      on the language itself. But JC3 has no limits. You can use\n      all language features like annotations, enhanced for-loops\n      etc... (except floating point)</li>\n\n      <li>Rich API: This is mixture of CLDC, GCF, Servlet,\n      JavaCard2 API, Sockets, Threads, Transactions ...</li>\n\n      <li>\n        Three application models and two library models, which\n        makes it possible to have virtually any kind of secure\n        application on JC3: \n\n        <ul>\n          <li>Servlets, extended-Applets, Classic-Applets</li>\n\n          <li>Extension-Library and Classic-Library</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n\n      <li>Servlet Container with Servlet 2.5 support.</li>\n\n      <li>HTTP and HTTPS interface: No need for special client\n      programming. Use any web client to reach JC3.</li>\n\n      <li>Still tiny(!!):24K RAM, 128K EEPROM, 512K ROM with a 32\n      bit processor</li>\n\n      <li>It is not just \"Card\" any more: With the newly added USB\n      interface this technology can go beyond Smart Cards into\n      devices like secure USB tokens, Secure Personal Databases,\n      Embedded Servers, WebDAV compliant thumb drives and\n      more.</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <ul class=\"noindent\">\n      <li>Last but not least, there is a <a href=\n      \"http://weblogs.java.net/blog/timboudreau/archive/2009/05/sneak_preview_j_1.html\">Netbeans\n      Plugin for easy development</a>. Nightly builds of NetBeans\n      point to the latest JavaCard plugin.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </dd>\n</dl>The team has a <a href=\n\"http://kenai.com/projects/javacard/pages/Home\">Kenai project that\nstarted recently</a>\n",
