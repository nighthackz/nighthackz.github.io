Today marks 40 years of the internet, although there's some debate
as to the actual date. I consider myself a latecomer: I didn't get
my first real internet email address until 1977, C410JG40@CMUA. I
was "jag" on various Unix systems before then, but it wasn't until
1977 that the ARPAnet and email really took over my life. I soon
realized that the only real-world friendships I kept up with were
folks that I could send email to. I disappeared from my brother and
sister's lives until they got email addresses 20 years later. Of
course now it's gotten to the point where restaurants don't exist
unless they're on <a href="http://opentable.com">OpenTable</a> :-)
I wrote the original Unix Emacs in 1978 and because of that by
sometime in 1980 I had the unusual distinction of having login IDs
on every non-military host on the ARPAnet (I kept track - it had
become sport). 

<p>When I joined Sun in 1984 (yikes! Has it been that long?) one of
the big attractions was Sun's position on networking: every machine
had a network connection. At the time, that was considered pretty
weird. I had known Bill and Andy for years. They had both tried to
get me to join Sun at the beginning in 82, but I foolishly didn't.
"The Network is the Computer" was a pretty odd tagline at the time,
and it didn't make sense to most people, but it had geeky appeal. A
lot could be done when you tied machines together: from harnessing
the compute power of clusters of machines, accessing filesystems
remotely via NFS, remote graphics access, and a whole lot more.</p>

<p>But the network had more than mere geek appeal for me. It felt
<i>important</i> in a world-changing kind of way. This crystalized
when I read <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Axelrod">Robert Axelrod</a>'s
1984 book <a href=
"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0465021212/ref=ase_jamesgoslingA/"><i>The
Evolution of Cooperation</i></a>. This is a reasonably accessible
game theory book that discusses experiments involving <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_Dilemma">the Prisoners
Dilemma</a>. I won't repeat what you can find by reading the <a
href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Evolution_of_Cooperation">Wikipedia
article</a> (which I urge you to do; read the book too). But by the
end of the book, there is a strong conclusion that <i>as the
frequency of interaction increases, the optimal strategy shifts
from hostility to cooperation</i>. This really appealed to my 60's
peacenik leanings because it suggested that all you needed to do
was to get people communicating, and inevitably peace would break
out. It doesn't matter much the form the communication takes, all
is good.</p>

<p>At that point in my life, the network went from a geeky toy to a
moral good. I don't know how to express how thrilled I am at how it
has all played out. From the effects of the network in keeping the
<a href=
"http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/academic/communications/logs/report-ussr-gorbatchev">news</a>
flowing during the <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Soviet_coup_d'%E9tat_attempt">1991
Soviet coup d'&#233;tat attempt</a>, to FaceBook, Twitter, Blogging
and all of todays social media.</p>

<p>These days I think that Sun should shorten its tagline from "The
Network is the Computer" to simply "The Network
<i><b>Is</b></i>".</p>

<p>My biggest disappointment with the internet is that it seems
that the "killer app" that makes the economics of the Internet work
is advertising...</p>
