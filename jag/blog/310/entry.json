  "title" : "OMG - Alan Turing gets an apology!",
  "body" : "It's decades late, but a lovely gesture none-the-less: Gordon\nBrown, the Prime Minister of Britain has <a href=\n\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page20571\">formally apologized for the\ntreatment of Alan Turing</a>. It's hard to overstate his impact on\nthe latter half of the 20th century, and the discipline of computer\nscience in particular. Think of what your life would have been like\nwithout him: a longer and more devastating second world war; and\nthe development of computers delayed by many years. How much better\ncould the world have been if his life had not been cut short by\nthoughtless intolerance? For details, as always, consult <a href=\n\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing\">wikipedia</a>.\n",
