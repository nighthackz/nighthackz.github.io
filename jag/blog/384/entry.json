  "body" : "Some folks from Bloomberg visited our engineering site in Hawaii\nand did a great video of the Wave Glider robot in action: \n\n<center><iframe src=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/api/embed/iframe?id=7~BC0zHQRvu86vt2Rrxk1A\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" frameborder=0 width=670 height=377></iframe></center>\nIt's amazing to see how people react to the robot. There was\nan ocean engineering conference in Hawaii several weeks ago, not\nfar from our engineering site. Most long-time oceanography folks\nlisten to the pitch about our robot and it really doesn't make\nsense to them, if only because it doesn't have a propeller and can\nstay out at sea for a long time. We hired a local dive shop to take\nconference attendees to swim with the robot, and for many it was\nquite an epiphany: grabbing onto the robot and having it pull you\nthrough the water with just the power of the waves is quite an\nexperience. The underwater wings are amazingly graceful. It's a\nvery elegant piece of engineering. \n\n<p>If you're interested in joining the fun, we're having <a href=\n\"http://liquidr.com/pacx\">4 Wave Gliders cross the Pacific</a> and\nwe'll be continuously publishing all the data on a website as they\ngo along. Anyone: researchers, hobbyists, students... can grab the\ndata and look for interesting things. It could make for an\ninteresting science fair project. [the website will be up and\nrunning and populated with data as soon as I can get it done]</p>\n\n",
