<td valign=top class=content><div class=entry><h1>Cool robot video</h1>
Some folks from Bloomberg visited our engineering site in Hawaii
and did a great video of the Wave Glider robot in action:

It's amazing to see how people react to the robot. There was
an ocean engineering conference in Hawaii several weeks ago, not
far from our engineering site. Most long-time oceanography folks
listen to the pitch about our robot and it really doesn't make
sense to them, if only because it doesn't have a propeller and can
stay out at sea for a long time. We hired a local dive shop to take
conference attendees to swim with the robot, and for many it was
quite an epiphany: grabbing onto the robot and having it pull you
through the water with just the power of the waves is quite an
experience. The underwater wings are amazingly graceful. It's a
very elegant piece of engineering. 

<p>If you're interested in joining the fun, we're having <a href=
"http://liquidr.com/pacx">4 Wave Gliders cross the Pacific</a> and
we'll be continuously publishing all the data on a website as they
go along. Anyone: researchers, hobbyists, students... can grab the
data and look for interesting things. It could make for an
interesting science fair project. [the website will be up and
running and populated with data as soon as I can get it done]</p>
