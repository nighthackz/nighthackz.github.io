<div class=entry><h1>Lessons from last years t-shirt contest entrants</h1>
Last years t-shirt contest entrants are pretty interesting to look
at as a group to reflect on what they say about engineering in
general. 

<p>In third place were the "Caffeinators" and their calibrated
crossbow/slingshot. From an engineering point of view it was the
simplest: a big elastic cord and a wooden frame. Nothing fancy.
Nothing to break down. Simple to operate. While they came in last,
they managed to fling more t-shirts to the audience than either of
the other entrants. By a wide margin. Easily the most effective
t-shirt distribution mechanism of the lot.<br clear="both">
</p>

<p>In second place was a very impressive cannon from Ron Hughes and
the folks from <a href="http://visicomp.com/" shape=
"rect">Visicomp</a>, who make some killer developer tools. Their
cannon was an absolute engineering marvel. Automated azimuth and
elevation. Remote firing over the web. Calibrated gas pressure for
range control. Beautifully machined. But it took longer to reload
than the slingshot. And it was <i>really</i> powerful. Far too
powerful for the folks responsible for the safety of the audience:
they had Ron throttle back the tank pressure significantly. Ron did
get in a little fun: at the end of his turn on stage, he removed
the pressure limiter and we fired off one shirt at full pressure.
Not many people in the audience noticed, but it was pretty
impressive: the shirt went way past the last row in the audience...
It's trajectory had hardly started to curve when it ricocheted off
the concrete wall way at the back of the very large hall that the
keynotes were held in.</p>

<p>The winner was a real contraption: a bicyle-built-for-two with
no wheels, connected to a flywheel that functioned like a baseball
pitching machine. The gizmo has a "magazine" that allows many
rolled-up t-shirts to be stacked up and released in quick
succession. A "machine-gun" for t-shirts. When it worked properly,
it hurled t-shirts a great distance. But... It really was a
Rub-Goldberg-esque contraption. A <i>hack</i> in the best sense of
the word. As such, it had more than a few reliability problems.
When the time came for it to perform, it's drive chain broke after
only 3 shirts were launched. But the audience loved it anyway.</p>

<p>Each of these could have won if the criteria were chosen
appropriately: the crossbow would have won on the basis of shirts
actually delivered. The canon would have won based on range and
engineering excellence. The third could have won on launch rate, if
only it hadn't broken... In the end, the audience chose based on
whatever moved each individual in the audience.</p>
