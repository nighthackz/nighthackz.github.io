It's\ncoming along pretty nicely, although it has been a bumpy ride for\nthe past couple of weeks - the lawyers made me shut it down for a\nfew days while I added a \"feature\": contributors need to sign a <a\nhref=\"http://doc.java.sun.com/DocWeb/contrib.html\">contribution\nagreement</a> so that we have the right to publish the translations\non our website. \n\n<p>There have been a lot of changes, but the most noticable are\nthat users names can now contain characters outside of 7-bit ascii\n- this was a bigger fight than expected (I love \"standards\"); and a\nsilly bug that caused documents to be returned in the wrong\nlanguage, even if the right one was available (oddly enough, mostly\nhapped for English. English is always available, but sometimes\nsomething else would be returned).</p>\n\n<p>There's also a developing \"Top 10\" page that contains some\ninteresting statistics, like the top translators in each language,\nand the languages with the most activity. I thought the Brazilians\n(Portuguese) were sure to be the most active, but they're being\nbeaten by the French, Hungarians (way to go keseruk!) and\nGermans.</p>\n\n<p>There's lot's more to do. I've been experimenting with various\ndifferent navigation methods (other than the giant scrolling\nlists). It's endless.</p>\n\n<p>If you haven't given it a try, try it out.</p>\n\n",
