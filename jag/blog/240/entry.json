  "body" : "A slice of Bay Area history passed away a few days ago: Alfred\nPeet, the founder of <a href=\"http://www.peets.com\">Peet's\ncoffee</a>. You can go to Starbucks for some mild-mannered coffee,\nbut if you need to get really cranked up, nothing beats Peet's.\nFortunately he taught a new generation of roasters, so my daily\npilgramage to Peet's can continue to keep me going. I usually go to\nthe Menlo Park shop, which is the second-oldest Peet's. There's\nalways a line out the door every morning.\n\n<p>A small piece of Peet's trivia: one of Jonathan's first acts as\nCEO was to get a Peet's shop into Sun's two main campuses in the\nBay Area. Another: Peet's became nationally famous when folks\nstarted to notice that Judge Lance Ito, during the OJ Simpson\ntrial, always had a mug of Peets in front of him - he got hooked on\nPeets as a student in Berkeley.</p>\n\n",
