  "body" : "I've spent the last few days in <a href=\n\"http://www.destination360.com/europe/denmark/aarhus\">Aarhus,\nDenmark</a> at the GOTO conference - which was formerly known as\nJAOO. One of the things I like about my post-sun life is that I get\nto give talks other than a generic \"state of the union\". In this\ncase, on the hacking I've been doing to help out on a <a href=\n\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exdUD02JryI&amp;feature=related\">fun\nproject at VW/Stanford</a> (but that's another whole series of blog\nposts). JAOO/GOTO is a great conference. One of the unusual things\nthey do as a commercial conference is that the content and schedule\nisn't driven by sponsors. Rather than putting out a generic \"call\nfor papers\" (which in many conferences gets tied to sponsorship),\nthe organizers map out technical trends and then invite speakers in\nthe midst of those technologies. I particularly enjoyed the tracks\non NoSQL and web-scale infrastructure. Rather than pitching\nparticular products, the speakers did an excellent job of covering\nthe whole technical debate and the tradeoffs.\n",
