<td valign=top class=content><div class=entry><h1>Transcendental Meditation</h1>
<img align=right src='2005_07_27_10-42-09-387_n1.small.png'>I got into a conversation with some folks who've been moving a
large sophisticated image processing application to Java. They've
been getting great performance numbers, much to the surprise of the
C crowd in their shop. 

<p style="text-align: left">With one exception: code that invokes
sin() and cos() heavily is somewhat slower. They asked me why this
was happening. I had a pretty good idea, but I checked with Joe
Darcy, our local Floating Point God, and he had this to say:</p>

<p style="text-align: left"><i>For many years, the JDK on x86
platforms has used the hardware fsin/fcos x87 instructions in the
range [-</i>pi<i>/4,</i> pi<i>/4], a range which encompasses about
half of all representable floating-point values. Therefore, in that
range the performance of the JDK's transcendental functions should
be nearly the same as the performance of the transcendental
functions in C, C++, etc. that are using those same fsin/fcos
instructions. Benchmarks which focus on testing the trig
performance of large values, such as almabench, present a skewed
portrait of Java's trigonometric performance. The next question is
why don't we just use fsin/fcos over the entire floating-point
range? The simple answer is that fsin/fcos can deliver answers that
are arbitrarily wrong for the most straightforward way of measuring
error in the result.</i></p>

<p style="text-align: left"><i>Every finite real number, no matter
how large, has a well-defined value for sin/cos. Ideally, the
floating-point result returned for sin/cos would be the
representable floating-point number closest to the mathematically
defined result for the floating-point input. A floating-point
library having this property is called correctly rounded, which is
equivalent to saying the library has an error bound less than or
equal to 1/2 an ulp (unit in the last place). For sin/cos, writing
a correctly rounding implementation that runs at a reasonable speed
is still something of a research problem so in practice platforms
often use a library with a 1 ulp error bound instead, which means
either of the floating-point numbers adjacent to the true result
can be returned. This is the implementation criteria the Java Math
library has to meet. The implementation challenge is that sin/cos
are implemented using argument reduction whereby any input is
mapped into a corresponding input in the [-</i>pi<i>/4,</i>
pi<i>/4] range. Since the period of sin/cos is</i> pi <i>and</i> pi
<i>is transcendental, this amounts to having to compute a remainder
from the division by a transcendental number, which is non-obvious.
A few years after the x87 was designed, people figured out how to
do this division as if by an exact value of</i> pi<i>. Instead the
x87 fsin/fcos use a particular approximation to</i> pi<i>, which
effectively means the period of the function is changed, which can
lead to large errors outside [-</i>pi<i>/4,</i> pi<i>/4]. For
example the value of sine for the floating-point number Math.PI is
around</i></p>

<p style="margin-left: 30.0; text-align: left">
<i>1.2246467991473532E-16</i></p>

<p style="text-align: left"><i>while the computed value from fsin
is</i></p>

<p style="margin-left: 30.0; text-align: left"><i>1.2246<span
style="color: #CC0000">063538223773E-16</span></i></p>

<p style="text-align: left"><i>In other words, instead of getting
the full 15-17 digit accuracy of double, the returned result is
only correct to about 5 decimal digits. In terms of ulps, the error
is about 1.64e11 ulps, over *ten billion* ulps. With some effort,
I'm confident I could find results with the wrong sign, etc. There
is a rationale which can justify this behavior; however, it was
much more compelling before the argument reduction problem was
solved.</i></p>

<p style="text-align: left">This error has tragically become
un-fixable because of the compatibility requirements from one
generation to the next. The fix for this problem was figured out
quite a long time ago. In the excellent paper <i><a href=
"http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ARITH.1995.465368"
shape="rect">The K5 transcendental functions</a></i> by T. Lynch,
A. Ahmed, M. Schulte, T. Callaway, and R. Tisdale a technique is
described for doing argument reduction as if you had an infinitely
precise value for pi. As far as I know, the K5 is the only x86
family CPU that did sin/cos accurately. AMD went back to being
bit-for-bit compatibile with the old x87 behavior, assumably
because too many applications broke. Oddly enough, this is fixed in
Itanium.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">What we do in the JVM on x86 is
moderately obvious: we range check the argument, and if it's
outside the range [-<i>pi</i>/4, <i>pi</i>/4]we do the precise
range reduction by hand, and then call fsin.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">So Java is accurate, but slower. I've
never been a fan of "fast, but wrong" when "wrong" is roughly
random(). Benchmarks rarely test accuracy. "double sin(double
theta) { return 0; }" would be a great benchmark-compatible
implementation of sin(). For large values of theta, 0 would be
arguably more accurate since the absolute error is never greater
than 1. fsin/fcos can have absolute errors as large as 2 (correct
answer=1; returned result=-1).</p>

<p style="text-align: left">This is one of those area where no
matter what we do, we're screwed.</p>
