  "body" : "It's election season and the San Francisco Bay Area is a uniquely\nodd place to view it from. Odd in the sense that dissent is\nwonderfully normal here. In a sense it's a pointless place to hold\nanti-war demonstrations because (almost) everyone will agree with\nthe demonstrators. One of the local centers of dissent is my\nfavorite bookstore on the planet, <a href=\"http://citylights.com\"\nshape=\"rect\">City Lights</a>, co-founded by the poet <a href=\n\"http://www.citylights.com/beat/LF/CLLFtotal.html\" shape=\n\"rect\">Lawrence Ferlinghetti</a>. If you ever get to San Francisco,\nyou have to visit this bookstore.\n\n<p>The two people on the right side of the picture are my nephew\nEric and my daughter Kate.</p>\n\n",
