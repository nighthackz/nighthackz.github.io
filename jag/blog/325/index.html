<div class="floatImage">
  My next career<br>
  (enlarge)
</div>The couple of weeks that have passed since I resigned have
been amazing. All the touching comments on my blog, emails,
facebook and linkedin messages have been wonderful. It was an
incredible community of people that together did great things and
had a lot of fun. I've spent an awful lot of time reading these
messages and answering as many as I could. Between all this and
spending quality time with my lawyer, resigning has been a full
time job (before I quit, several friends said I'd need a lawyer
because "this is Oracle we're talking about"... sadly, they were
right). 

<p>There's been lots of speculation on what I'm likely to do next.
Darryl Taft's <a href=
"http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Application-Development/The-Life-and-Times-of-Java-and-James-Gosling-746438/">list</a>
covers some of the landscape, including some amusingly implausible
ones :-) I truly don't know what I'm going to do next. I didn't
leave Oracle because I had some next great thing to go to. I'm
feeling pretty burned out and trashed, so the only thing I know for
certain is that I'll be taking some time off.</p>

<p>These are interesting and challenging times. The global economy
is showing signs of life and the technological landscape has some
pretty interesting terrain, despite the apparent consolidation of
the industry through a rash of acquisitions. Here in Silicon
Valley, starting a company has become pretty tough: the traditional
method of getting funding from venture capitalists has largely
fallen apart. A couple of key factors have been the poor health of
the financial markets, making <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_strategy#In_business">exit
strategies</a> hard to come by; and the expensive and grotesque
mockery that <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarbanes%2013Oxley_Act">SOX</a>
compliance has become. But <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship#Financial_bootstrapping">bootstrap</a>
funding can be workable for service and support businesses, which
is a common model in the open source world. Given that a central
pillar of Oracle's acquisition methodology is making job offers
that involve a (often significant) salary cut, there are lots of
talented folks leaving and trying to figure out what to do next in
their lives. One significant positive impact looks like it's going
to be the creation of a whole pile of small businesses. It's
already happening, and I'm sure there will be a lot more.</p>

<p>Java is far from dead, it's path has become complicated, but
still vibrant. I'll still be involved. Not sure how yet.</p>

<p>One of my personality quirks that makes my "what's next"
question more difficult is that most of the things that interest me
are science projects rather than sensible business plans. Instead
of starting a company, I'll be having fun.</p>
