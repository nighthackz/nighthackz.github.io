All the touching comments on my blog, emails,\nfacebook and linkedin messages have been wonderful. It was an\nincredible community of people that together did great things and\nhad a lot of fun. I've spent an awful lot of time reading these\nmessages and answering as many as I could. Between all this and\nspending quality time with my lawyer, resigning has been a full\ntime job (before I quit, several friends said I'd need a lawyer\nbecause \"this is Oracle we're talking about\"... sadly, they were\nright). \n\n<p>There's been lots of speculation on what I'm likely to do next.\nDarryl Taft's <a href=\n\"http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Application-Development/The-Life-and-Times-of-Java-and-James-Gosling-746438/\">list</a>\ncovers some of the landscape, including some amusingly implausible\nones :-) I truly don't know what I'm going to do next. I didn't\nleave Oracle because I had some next great thing to go to. I'm\nfeeling pretty burned out and trashed, so the only thing I know for\ncertain is that I'll be taking some time off.</p>\n\n<p>These are interesting and challenging times. The global economy\nis showing signs of life and the technological landscape has some\npretty interesting terrain, despite the apparent consolidation of\nthe industry through a rash of acquisitions. Here in Silicon\nValley, starting a company has become pretty tough: the traditional\nmethod of getting funding from venture capitalists has largely\nfallen apart. A couple of key factors have been the poor health of\nthe financial markets, making <a href=\n\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_strategy#In_business\">exit\nstrategies</a> hard to come by; and the expensive and grotesque\nmockery that <a href=\n\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarbanes%2013Oxley_Act\">SOX</a>\ncompliance has become. But <a href=\n\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship#Financial_bootstrapping\">bootstrap</a>\nfunding can be workable for service and support businesses, which\nis a common model in the open source world. Given that a central\npillar of Oracle's acquisition methodology is making job offers\nthat involve a (often significant) salary cut, there are lots of\ntalented folks leaving and trying to figure out what to do next in\ntheir lives. One significant positive impact looks like it's going\nto be the creation of a whole pile of small businesses. It's\nalready happening, and I'm sure there will be a lot more.</p>\n\n<p>Java is far from dead, it's path has become complicated, but\nstill vibrant. I'll still be involved. Not sure how yet.</p>\n\n<p>One of my personality quirks that makes my \"what's next\"\nquestion more difficult is that most of the things that interest me\nare science projects rather than sensible business plans. Instead\nof starting a company, I'll be having fun.</p>\n\n",
