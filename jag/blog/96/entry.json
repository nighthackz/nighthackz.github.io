  "body" : "One of the tragedies of having to work at this conference is that I\nhave to be up and working at 8am tomorrow. This is a regular thing\nand <i>really</i> cramps the after hours activities. This evening I\nwent out with the JPL folks for dinner and we had a great time.\nAfter we had finished eating a lovely dinner at LuLu, one of the\nJPL folks, Mark Indictor, pulled out his fiddle and started to\nplay. He's <i>really</i> good. If any of you were in LuLu and heard\nhim, you got quite a treat. He was just getting cranked up and I\nhad to leave: I was (am!) falling over tired and I have be up\nearly... A great day.\n",
