  "body" : "Oscar Salguero Guandique from El Salvador was the first finalist in\nthis years <a href=\"https://tshc.dev.java.net/\" shape=\n\"rect\">t-shirt hurling contest</a> to show his stuff. It was a\nbelt-driven contraption with a big electic motor at one end. It\nshould have worked really well, but ended up somewhat\nheartbreaking: just before the keynote started I went back to check\non how his tuning was going. As I walked up there was a very\ndistinct characteristic smell that anyone who works around\nelectical stuff gets to learn well: there was smoke billowing out\nof the motor housing that made the situation clear. When he finally\ngot to shooting shirts, there wasn't a whole lot of oompf left in\nthe motor. Noetheless, it was still a lot of fun.\n",
