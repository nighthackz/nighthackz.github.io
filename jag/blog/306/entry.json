They've got a <a href=\n\"http://jazoon.com/en/conference/schedule.html\">great lineup of\ntechnical sessions</a> to pump your head full of all the latest\neverything. The lineup of speakers is pretty impressive. \n\n<p>PS. Several folks have asked why I disappeared from JavaOne so\nquickly after my <a href=\n\"http://java.sun.com/javaone/2009/general_sessions.jsp?pid=24589760001\">Toy\nShow</a> keynote: my youngest daughter's school was holding a\ntalent show at noon, and I had to be there. Work is not at the top\nof life's priority list :-)</p>\n\n",
