  "body" : "In his <a href=\n\"http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/java_is_everywhere\">blog this\nmorning</a>, Jonathan announced that Sun is changing its stock\nsymbol from SUNW to JAVA. Totally bizarre from a geek vantage\npoint, but totally sensible in terms of marketing and brand\nawareness. It's been quite a road from a <a href=\n\"https://duke.dev.java.net/green/\">small group of malcontents</a>\nto todays mission-critical systems. Java has changed Sun, and Sun\nhas changed Java (for example, we had a lot to learn from the\nSolaris crowd about testing and quality). It keeps feeling like the\nfun has only just begun.\n",
