Toronto is a pretty active place with a lot\nof talent doing interesting things. \n\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">We spent today going through all the\nnew stuff in NetBeans 5, including my current favorite feature: the\nrapid plugin development tools. It's straightforward to build a\n(simple) plugin in 30 seconds, and deploy&amp;test it. Far easier\nthan writing emacs lisp extensions :-)</p>\n\n",
