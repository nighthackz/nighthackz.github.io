The call-for-papers closes <a href=\n\"https://www28.cplan.com/cfp_2006J1/CFPLogin.jsp\" shape=\n\"rect\">November 30th</a>. Do a really good job on your abstracts:\nthere are always far more proposals than available time slots. And\nit's time to start thinking seriously about ideas for the <a href=\n\"https://tshc.dev.java.net/rules/\" shape=\"rect\">T-Shirt hurling\ncontest</a>. Cash! Free passes to JavaOne! You just have to figure\nout how to get some t-shirts into the audience. Last year was a\nreal lesson in engineering: 2 out of 3 entries broke, but in\ninteresting ways: one \"over tested\" and burned out his motor; the\nother had their IR sensors prematurly triggered by the\nphotographers cameras.
