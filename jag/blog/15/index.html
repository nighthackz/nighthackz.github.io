<img align=right src='Image46-large.jpeg'>Yes, it's on. We havn't quite figured out the rules of the contest
or the process by which it is run. But interested folks should
start thinking about wierd and interesting ways to get t-shirts
delivered to an audience. In the past I've just used my arm, used
various slingshots, a compressed air cannon, and built a medieval
siege weapon (a trebuchet). But I <b>know</b> that there are many
people who could come up with much more creative solutions. There's
really only one rule: 

<div style=
"font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; text-align: center">
  Don't Freak Out the Fire Marshal
</div>

<p>This is a pretty broad rule. There are many corollaries that
should be pretty obvious. Things like "No maiming the audience".
Also, by the nature of the contest, t-shirts have to be delivered
somehow to the audience within the confines of the conference
hall.</p>

<p>The current proposal for how to run the contest is to do it in
two phases: first: entrants submit proposals that get judged by a
panel. second: the top three actually build/perform/whatever their
proposal in front of the JavaOne crowd and the winner gets chosen
then. This would allow people from all over the world to enter.
It's not clear what the prize would be, but I'm trying to arrange
for there to be a financial component: the three finalists would
receive the money for the third prize award a couple of months
before JavaOne (it's clear at that point that each of them will win
at least that much). Then at JavaOne the first and second prize
winners get their awards. That way, there's some cash to help
entrants defray the cost of constructing their entries. But it's
not clear that this is possible: it turns out that when there are
cash awards involved, there are special legal requirements on
contests. We're still trying to figure it out.</p>

<p>So get creative! Explore your inner geek! Or your inner artist!
Left brain! Right brain! All kinds of stuff could be cool.... Rail
Guns? (they'll need one hell of a safety plan) Taiko Drums? Blimps?
Dancing troups? The possibilities are endless. <i>Get Cool</i></p>
