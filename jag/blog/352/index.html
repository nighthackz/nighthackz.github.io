<td valign=top class=content><div class=entry><h1>Steve Jobs Comments on Apple's Java Discontinuation</h1>
<img align=right src='110033-java_cup.jpg'>Macrumors has an article on <a href=
"http://www.macrumors.com/2010/10/22/steve-jobs-comments-on-apples-java-discontinuation/">the
fuss about Java on the Mac</a>. They quote Jobs as saying: 

<blockquote>
  Sun (now Oracle) supplies Java for all other platforms. They have
  their own release schedules, which are almost always different
  than ours, so the Java we ship is always a version behind. This
  may not be the best way to do it.
</blockquote>It simply isn't true that "Sun (now Oracle) supplies
Java for all other platforms". IBM supplies Java for IBM's
platforms, HP for HP's, even Azul systems does the JVM for their
systems (admittedly, these all start with code from Snorcle - but
then, so does Apple). In the beginning, Microsoft provided Java for
Windows - but Sun took over when Microsoft violated their contract
and made Java code written on Windows unable to run on other
systems. Sun also provided the VM for Linux because there was no
one else to do it. In all the other cases, the platform owners
wanted to do the ports themselves so that they could put a lot of
energy into it, and because they knew the platforms better than
anyone else. Apple was the same: in the early days, they were
insistent on doing the port themselves. They put terrific energy
into it. They did a good job. But then, as OS X took hold and Apple
was able to convince developers to target their
non-portable/proprietary environment, Apple's fundamental
control-freak tendency took over and they put less and less energy
into Java. It also didn't help that the early ports that they did
were heavily customized - far more than they needed to be. This
made upgrading to subsequent releases very hard, and for quite a
while Apple's JVM lagged behind all other platforms. But they
eventually got their act together and their JVM upgrade pipeline
got streamlined and they kept up very well in recent years. 

<p>None the less, there were recurring discussions about having Sun
or <a href="http://landonf.bikemonkey.org/static/soylatte/">the
community</a> shoulder the burden. There were lots of obstacles.
One was that a lot of Apple's web sites (MobileMe, iTunes, the app
store) were Java apps and they were nervous about not doing the QA
themselves. The point became somewhat moot because Apple ended up
using a lot of Sun hardware (yes!). But the biggest obstacle was
their use of <a href=
"http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2008/02/finding-a-worm-in-the-apple-secret-apis-in-mac-os-x.ars">secret
APIs</a>. Yes, OS X has piles of secret APIs. Just like the ones
that Microsoft had that contributed to their antitrust problems.
The big area (that I'm aware of) where these are used is in
graphics rendering.</p>

<p>A particularly ironic area was in aliased versus antialiased
rendering: Apple's graphics pipeline is well designed: they do
antialiasing beautifully throughout. The Java graphics spec has
some careful wording to allow Apple-style antialiased-only
pipelines to be used. Code that works well with this style of
rendering is easy to write. Unfortunately, old Microsoft platforms
only supported aliased rendering, and some (this was rare)
applications would have rendering artifacts if antialiasing was
turned on. These applications were broken according to the spec,
and most authors fixed their apps so that they worked in both
cases. But one developer took a serious "fuck you" attitude on this
issue and forced Apple to implement aliased rendering - which they
kept secret because it was such an awful thing to have to do. The
"one developer"? Oracle, of course...</p>
