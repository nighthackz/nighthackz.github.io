<div class=entry><h1>Too Soon</h1>
It was just a few weeks ago that everyone was writing about <a
href="entry/steve_jobs_resigns_as_apple.html">Steve Jobs'
resignation</a>. The implication was clear, but I had hoped he
would have more time. There have been lots of articles written. <a
href="http://www.economist.com/node/21531529">The Economist wrote a
particularly powerful one</a>. 

<p>Steve was unique. Apple cannot replace him, and I don't think
that they should try. He was a messiah. Within the company there
was a cultish reverence towards him. He was famously difficult to
work for and unrelentingly demanding of perfection. I interviewed
for jobs with him 3 times: once before he was fired, once at NeXT,
and once after he returned. Each was a long lunch at The Good
Earth. Each was a wonderful, intriguing conversation, but I left
each thinking "no, I can't work for this man: he's mad!". That
visionary madness drove him and his company with a tremendous
force. He was personally not an engineer or a designer, but he had
a tremendous sense for excellence. Many companies use "focus
groups" to help them refine products, but not Apple: they just had
Steve. He was often criticized for being a "control freak", but
that was all in pursuit of excellence: anything out of his control
was out of his ability to improve. He didn't just have a sense for
Apple's products, he had a sense for Apple's customers and what
would delight them. As much as he was devoted to Apple, he was more
devoted to Apple's customers. One of the biggest drivers of Apple's
success in recent years is the delight their customers feel in
every part of the process, even something as simple as opening a
box is thought through carefully. Every detail matters.</p>

<p>So what is a Post-Steve Apple? Even though everyone there has
been mentally preparing for this moment, it is still a shock. Will
Apple crystalize and just repeat the playbook? That will be
successful for a few years, but it will eventually veer off. They
collectively need to find a new way. There won't be a new Steve.
There will certainly be apostolic claimants, but they won't be
Steve. The New Apple will have to be a collective result of Steve's
teaching to each employee individually. His pursuit of excellence
will no longer be imposed - it now has to come from the hearts of
everyone.</p>

<p>It is a new world.</p>
