  "body" : "It was just a few weeks ago that everyone was writing about <a\nhref=\"entry/steve_jobs_resigns_as_apple.html\">Steve Jobs'\nresignation</a>. The implication was clear, but I had hoped he\nwould have more time. There have been lots of articles written. <a\nhref=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21531529\">The Economist wrote a\nparticularly powerful one</a>. \n\n<p>Steve was unique. Apple cannot replace him, and I don't think\nthat they should try. He was a messiah. Within the company there\nwas a cultish reverence towards him. He was famously difficult to\nwork for and unrelentingly demanding of perfection. I interviewed\nfor jobs with him 3 times: once before he was fired, once at NeXT,\nand once after he returned. Each was a long lunch at The Good\nEarth. Each was a wonderful, intriguing conversation, but I left\neach thinking \"no, I can't work for this man: he's mad!\". That\nvisionary madness drove him and his company with a tremendous\nforce. He was personally not an engineer or a designer, but he had\na tremendous sense for excellence. Many companies use \"focus\ngroups\" to help them refine products, but not Apple: they just had\nSteve. He was often criticized for being a \"control freak\", but\nthat was all in pursuit of excellence: anything out of his control\nwas out of his ability to improve. He didn't just have a sense for\nApple's products, he had a sense for Apple's customers and what\nwould delight them. As much as he was devoted to Apple, he was more\ndevoted to Apple's customers. One of the biggest drivers of Apple's\nsuccess in recent years is the delight their customers feel in\nevery part of the process, even something as simple as opening a\nbox is thought through carefully. Every detail matters.</p>\n\n<p>So what is a Post-Steve Apple? Even though everyone there has\nbeen mentally preparing for this moment, it is still a shock. Will\nApple crystalize and just repeat the playbook? That will be\nsuccessful for a few years, but it will eventually veer off. They\ncollectively need to find a new way. There won't be a new Steve.\nThere will certainly be apostolic claimants, but they won't be\nSteve. The New Apple will have to be a collective result of Steve's\nteaching to each employee individually. His pursuit of excellence\nwill no longer be imposed - it now has to come from the hearts of\neveryone.</p>\n\n<p>It is a new world.</p>\n\n",
