    with many fond memories. Today I start a new Adventure at Amazon Web Services.
            I'll mostly be working on IoT-related projects, but I'm sure to get dragged
            into projects all over the map.  Including OpenJDK.

            personal stuff, and 
            <a href=https://twitter.com/errcraft>Twitter</a> for work-related stuff.",
