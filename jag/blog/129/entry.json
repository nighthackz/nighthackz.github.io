His entry was truly medieval: he\n        built a Trebuchet. Two years ago, I built one of these for\n        JavaOne (with much help from Dale Yoakum). I kinda learned\n        how they worked as I built it. Ron clearly knew how they\n        worked from the beginning: his had a very clean release\n        that resulted in beautiful flawless flat arcs. Totally\n        reliable. No wires, motors or computers. \n\n        <p style=\"text-align: left\">Peter Moore and his mates from\n        Cenqua in Australia came in second, and Oscar Guandique\n        from El Salvadore came in third.</p>\n\n        <p style=\"text-align: left\">They all got silly\n        certificates, a cheque and (surprise) a sun workstation\n        (the winner got two). It was a huge amount of fun. All put\n        in excellent efforts. There are some interesting lessons\n        about the practice of engineering here.</p>\n\n        <p style=\"text-align: left\">Start thinking about your entry\n        for next year!</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </table>\n</div>\n",
