It got me cranked up about a project we had done at Sun\nyears ago. <a href=\n\"http://mediacast.sun.com/share/jag/green.mpeg\">Fortunately, we had\nmade a video of it in 1992 that I managed to find a copy of.</a>\nIt's really badly done (it was done for a UI conference\npresentation), but it shows a lot of interesting points (for\nexample, the grid-style TV schedule browser).
