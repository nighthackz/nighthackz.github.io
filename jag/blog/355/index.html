<div class=entry><h1>Back from the Sanity Rally</h1>
We got back last night from the <a href=
"http://www.rallytorestoresanity.com/">Rally to Restore Sanity
and/or Fear</a> in DC. It was one of the most wonderful experiences
I've had in a very long time. The crowd was immense: they had 5
rows of jumbotrons, each row spaced almost a football-field's width
from each other, progressing farther and farther away from the
stage. We showed up 2.5 hours early, and ended up 4 jumbotrons back
from the stage. There was no chance of seeing anything on the stage
directly. With a 400mm telephoto I could just barely make out
figures on the stage. Folks that showed up less than a couple of
hours early were so far away, seeing even a jumbotron was unlikely.
But for all the size of the crowd, everyone was incredibly
reasonable. 

<p>The show that Stewart and Colbert put on was totally wonderful.
Lots of really good bits: the benediction by Father Guido Sarducci;
the singing duel between Yusuf Islam (formerly Cat Stevens) singing
Peace Train and Ozzy Osborne singing Crazy Train - finally
reconciled by the O'Jays singing Love Train; and Stewart's
heartfelt monologue were at the top of my list. But it was all
good.</p>

<p>I <a href=
"http://gallery.me.com/james.gosling#100150&amp;view=mosaic&amp;sel=0&amp;bgcolor=ltgrey">took
a whole lot of pictures</a>, but not many worked out. When you're
in the middle of such a huge crowd, there's no way to get a real
perspective on the crowd, and we were so far back that even with a
400mm lens, figures on stage were just blobs.</p>

<p>And folks everywhere had great posters</p>
