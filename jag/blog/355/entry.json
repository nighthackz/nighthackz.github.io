  "body" : "We got back last night from the <a href=\n\"http://www.rallytorestoresanity.com/\">Rally to Restore Sanity\nand/or Fear</a> in DC. It was one of the most wonderful experiences\nI've had in a very long time. The crowd was immense: they had 5\nrows of jumbotrons, each row spaced almost a football-field's width\nfrom each other, progressing farther and farther away from the\nstage. We showed up 2.5 hours early, and ended up 4 jumbotrons back\nfrom the stage. There was no chance of seeing anything on the stage\ndirectly. With a 400mm telephoto I could just barely make out\nfigures on the stage. Folks that showed up less than a couple of\nhours early were so far away, seeing even a jumbotron was unlikely.\nBut for all the size of the crowd, everyone was incredibly\nreasonable. \n\n<p>The show that Stewart and Colbert put on was totally wonderful.\nLots of really good bits: the benediction by Father Guido Sarducci;\nthe singing duel between Yusuf Islam (formerly Cat Stevens) singing\nPeace Train and Ozzy Osborne singing Crazy Train - finally\nreconciled by the O'Jays singing Love Train; and Stewart's\nheartfelt monologue were at the top of my list. But it was all\ngood.</p>\n\n<p>I <a href=\n\"http://gallery.me.com/james.gosling#100150&amp;view=mosaic&amp;sel=0&amp;bgcolor=ltgrey\">took\na whole lot of pictures</a>, but not many worked out. When you're\nin the middle of such a huge crowd, there's no way to get a real\nperspective on the crowd, and we were so far back that even with a\n400mm lens, figures on stage were just blobs.</p>\n\n<p>And folks everywhere had great posters</p>\n\n",
