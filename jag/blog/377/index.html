<div class=entry><h1>Some more detail</h1>
It's been a pretty shaky day. Last night, those of us who have been
renting the box together for years got together for dinner. Those
of you from Sun might remember Rob Gingell, BIll Meine and Jim
Mitchell. Jean Elliott was at dinner, and was supposed to be with
us in the box seat, but she couldn't be there on Friday. We spent a
lot of time talking about the experience. Normally, when one of
these planes has a problem, it's something to do with the engine.
The pilot retains some level of control and is able to fly (glide?)
it to a generally safe landing. One such incident occurred on
Thursday where the pilot had to belly-land in the desert. But this
crash was different: it was clearly a control system problem. The
engine seemed to be running full throttle until the very end. The
plane pitched up and it appeared that the pilot was trying to climb
up out of the race zone - the planes typically race pretty close to
the ground. 100feet-ish. 

<p>But after climbing for a few seconds the plane jerked again and
rolled into an almost vertical nose down descent. I (and everyone
else in the box) were looking directly at the plane through this
whole thing. We watched it come straight down. We all have this
image of the plane coming directly at us. We saw the prop spinning
full speed, and nothing else but the wings. No fuselage or tail
poking out the sides. Straight into us. But then it jerked in it's
descent - during dinner we talked about this a lot and we all
remember the jerk - and it turned slightly to the east. When it
impacted it was still almost vertical, but since we were on the
acute side of the impact angle, most of the debris went away from
us. We were really <i>really</i> close to the impact, but not a
scratch. A lot of people were not so lucky. My heart goes out to
them. It was horrific.</p>

<p>This whole crash was a matter of just a couple of seconds.
Running wasn't physically possible. Race speed for the plane is
about 500mph. One second = 733 feet. If it impacted at that speed,
from the time that the nose first touched the runway, until the
last piece of the tail impacted would have been about 43
milliseconds (the plane was 32 feet long). People who have seen
pictures have asked "where is the wreckage?", but at those speeds,
almost the only largish chunk was the engine block. The rest was at
most an inch or two in size. Dust.</p>

<p>I didn't take any pictures of the descent, but I took several of
the crash site. I'll spare you most of them, but I've put one here.
Two things to notice: see that horizontal section of blue carpet?
Our box was 10 feet this side of it. I was standing in the aisle
behind the box when the impact happened. I took the picture from
where I was standing when the impact happened. The dust settled
extremely quickly. The second thing to notice is the hole. That's
the impact crater. And it wasn't your average city asphalt road:
the boxes were on a taxiway/parking apron of a dual
military/civilian airport. A tough surface.</p>

<p>The impact happened in the middle of the aisle between the first
and second rows of box seats, which saved a lot of lives. The
debris field stretches far out on the other side of the impact
point, angled slightly away from the bleachers - row one was almost
totally obliterated. Row two wasn't a happy place either. There are
more pictures at the <a href=
