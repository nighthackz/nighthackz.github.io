<div class=entry><h1>JavaOne 2009: another amazing experience.</h1>
This was another amazing JavaOne. It was also the weirdest: between
the Oracle situation, the global meltdown, and the financial
situation, it was very different. Early on, we were really
concerned (==nearly paniced) that no one would show up. Almost
every company that usually sends a crowd of people to JavaOne had
travel restrictions that meant that few could attend. From what we
had seen from other conferences, we feared the worst. And yet,
attendance ended up being about 15,000. Very respectable! 

<p>The press, of course, was weird this year: we did few
interviews, mostly because there was only one topic they wanted to
ask about, and there was nothing we could say.</p>

<p>My favorite part of JavaOne this year was the standing ovation
that Scott got on Monday. It was a remarkably emotional moment for
everyone. To all of you who contributed to that thundering
applause: Thanks!</p>

<p>Our lineup of new technologies was great: JDK7 is looking
wonderful; JavaFX reached another release milestone and is maturing
nicely, along with it's tools; glassfish V3 is becoming totally
wonderful; NetBeans 6.7+kenai is a killer combination; and the
store is on it's way to being an amazing addition.</p>

<p>The fun part, for me, is the <a href=
"http://java.sun.com/javaone/2009/general_sessions.jsp">Toy
Show</a>. It's not about strategic initiatives, business issues,
corporate relations, or new releases. It's all about jaw-dropping
surprise. Everything from the <a href="http://mifos.org/">Mifos
(MIcroFinance, Open Source)</a> project: bringing millions out of
poverty. To Manuel Tijerino's <a href=
"http://www.check1two.com/">jukebox</a> architected to give indie
musicians broad exposure and a source of revenue independent of the
studios. To teaching kids through <a href=
"http://bluej.org">BlueJ</a> and <a href=
"http://www.usfirst.org/what/frc/default.aspx?id=366">robotics
competitions</a>. And saving lives by doing <a href=
"http://www.visuvi.com/">computationally intensive image
matching</a> in an EE server with a JavaFX front end to analyse
cancer biopsies. And the total victory of technology and style over
common sense that is Neil Young's <a href=
"http://www.lincvolt.com">LincVolt</a>. And a whole lot more.</p>
