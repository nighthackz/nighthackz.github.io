Just barely. I'm at the air races in Reno with a bunch of friends
and a horrific accident just happened. One of the very high end
racers, going about 500 mph, lost control and nose dived straight
into the audience. The news is currently saying that the plane
missed the grandstand, but that's only technically true: in front
of the grandstand there are several rows of box seats. It impacted
right in the middle of them. I was in a box seat with my friends
only 40 feet from the impact. I was watching the plane as it lost
control, so I saw the whole thing. The impact happened so fast,
there was hardly any sound: just one huge shock wave. No fireball.
The plane, and many people, disintegrated instantly, right in front
of me. There were bodies everywhere. No crash you've ever seen in a
movie is even remotely authentic. 

<p><b>Update:</b> it's already on <a href=
"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCNePeKn3Tg&amp;feature=player_embedded">YouTube</a>[YouTube
pulled it]. I was in the middle of the dust cloud you see around
the impact. They're saying "30 serious injuries" but I know that's
a long way from the truth. Many died instantly in the impact. It
was not a small airplane. You either died or you didn't. I didn't.
My brother and I are still shaking.</p>

<p><b>Another Update:</b> They're now officially calling it a "mass
casualty situation". The plane was Galloping Ghost, piloted by
Jimmy Leeward. It was a very cool, highly modified, P51 mustang
with a very unusual approach to engine cooling. I doubt that this
was at all connected to the accident - it looked like a control
system failure.</p>
