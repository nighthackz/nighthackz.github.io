  "body" : "Just barely. I'm at the air races in Reno with a bunch of friends\nand a horrific accident just happened. One of the very high end\nracers, going about 500 mph, lost control and nose dived straight\ninto the audience. The news is currently saying that the plane\nmissed the grandstand, but that's only technically true: in front\nof the grandstand there are several rows of box seats. It impacted\nright in the middle of them. I was in a box seat with my friends\nonly 40 feet from the impact. I was watching the plane as it lost\ncontrol, so I saw the whole thing. The impact happened so fast,\nthere was hardly any sound: just one huge shock wave. No fireball.\nThe plane, and many people, disintegrated instantly, right in front\nof me. There were bodies everywhere. No crash you've ever seen in a\nmovie is even remotely authentic. \n\n<p><b>Update:</b> it's already on <a href=\n\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCNePeKn3Tg&amp;feature=player_embedded\">YouTube</a>[YouTube\npulled it]. I was in the middle of the dust cloud you see around\nthe impact. They're saying \"30 serious injuries\" but I know that's\na long way from the truth. Many died instantly in the impact. It\nwas not a small airplane. You either died or you didn't. I didn't.\nMy brother and I are still shaking.</p>\n\n<p><b>Another Update:</b> They're now officially calling it a \"mass\ncasualty situation\". The plane was Galloping Ghost, piloted by\nJimmy Leeward. It was a very cool, highly modified, P51 mustang\nwith a very unusual approach to engine cooling. I doubt that this\nwas at all connected to the accident - it looked like a control\nsystem failure.</p>\n\n",
