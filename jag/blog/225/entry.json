The pavillion was a madhouse as folks put together all of\ntheir booths. Some of the gizmos are pretty exciting. You have to\ncheck out \"poindexter\" a very strange (and fast) robotic arm. It's\nright next to the slot car track, which will be a lot of fun too.\nNearby you'll find the Wonderland/DarkStar folks (software for\nbuilding virtual worlds). There's piles of cool stuff everywhere. \n\n<p>Make sure you come to Rich Green's talk: he's got a lot of\ninteresting things to say and show. And at the end of his talk\nwe'll be doing the t-shirt toss.</p>\n\n",
