  "body" : "The Advanced Course in Sleep Deprivation that is JavaOne is just\nabout ready to start. Life has been pretty insane for quite a while\ngetting all the bits a pieces lined up. It's shaping up to be a\nparticularly fine conference this year. Lots of great courses. Lots\nof great parties. Lots of folks showing off stunning stuff. \n\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Picking the Duke's Choice award winners\nwas really hard this year, there were so many cool candidates. Same\nthing for the keynote demos: too many cool things to show off and\ntalk about, too little time. My keynote is on the last day. It's\nall toy show. Huge fun.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">And the finalists in the t-shirt\nhurling contest all have their rigs together, tested, and shipped\nto SF. Tapping their inner physicist. More major coolness that\nyou'll have to come to the keynotes to see.</p>\n\n",
