  "body" : "If you look at the vehicle tracks in my previous post, you'll see\nthat one vessel (Piccard Maru) has a track that's heading north,\nsomewhat erratically. The rudder module lost power, so now we can't\nsteer it, and it's drifting. We haven't finally decided yet, but\nit's close enough that we could go out to pick it up and see what\nreally happened. Right now the seas are too high and stormy to\nsafely head out. The suspicion is that the problem was caused by a\nmanufacturing defect in the <a href=\n\"http://liquidr.com/technology/wave-glider-concept/\">umbilical\ncable</a> that connects the two parts of the craft, which caused\nthe power line to fray.\n",
