I became a hardcore emacs user 29 years ago (yes! Really! The first
emacs I used was the excellent implementation on <a href=
"http://www.multicians.org/mepap.html">Multics by Bernie
Greenberg</a>). But a lot of time has passed since then and the
exponent in Moore's law has changed everything. And yet there's a
hardcore emacs population out there that I've been slowly trying to
convince to join the modern age. I had been exchanging email with
one of them, John Wetherill. He finally broke down, tried NetBeans,
and sent me this email: 

<p><tt>I've been a hardcore emacs user for 20 years, and after some
extremely horrible experiences with various IDEs, my resistance to
trying NetBeans was enormous. But after your suggestion I spent the
effort getting up to speed, and ... it's CHANGED MY LIFE! I can't
believe what a great tool NB is. I've been losing sleep discovering
all these cool features.</tt></p>

<p><tt>I can see that I will now view my development career as
"Before NetBeans" and "After NetBeans". I'm not exaggerating. It is
just that cool. I want to evangelize it, and plan on spending a bit
of time doing so at my J1 session.</tt></p>

<p><tt>OK I'll shut up now. Thanks for persuading me to switch.
:)</tt></p>

<p>'nuff said. I can't wait to see what he says after he tries out
the new code editor in NB6 (download the latest build from <a href=
"http://netbeans.org">netbeans.org</a>)</p>
