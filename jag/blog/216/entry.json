  "body" : "I became a hardcore emacs user 29 years ago (yes! Really! The first\nemacs I used was the excellent implementation on <a href=\n\"http://www.multicians.org/mepap.html\">Multics by Bernie\nGreenberg</a>). But a lot of time has passed since then and the\nexponent in Moore's law has changed everything. And yet there's a\nhardcore emacs population out there that I've been slowly trying to\nconvince to join the modern age. I had been exchanging email with\none of them, John Wetherill. He finally broke down, tried NetBeans,\nand sent me this email: \n\n<p><tt>I've been a hardcore emacs user for 20 years, and after some\nextremely horrible experiences with various IDEs, my resistance to\ntrying NetBeans was enormous. But after your suggestion I spent the\neffort getting up to speed, and ... it's CHANGED MY LIFE! I can't\nbelieve what a great tool NB is. I've been losing sleep discovering\nall these cool features.</tt></p>\n\n<p><tt>I can see that I will now view my development career as\n\"Before NetBeans\" and \"After NetBeans\". I'm not exaggerating. It is\njust that cool. I want to evangelize it, and plan on spending a bit\nof time doing so at my J1 session.</tt></p>\n\n<p><tt>OK I'll shut up now. Thanks for persuading me to switch.\n:)</tt></p>\n\n<p>'nuff said. I can't wait to see what he says after he tries out\nthe new code editor in NB6 (download the latest build from <a href=\n\"http://netbeans.org\">netbeans.org</a>)</p>\n\n",
