  "body" : "Several folks have asked for copies of my slides from Oracle\nOpenworld. Unfortunately, there's no printable form of them, since\nI did them as a JavaFX app. You'll find them at <a href=\n\"http://fxslideshowtest.kenai.com\">http://fxslideshowtest.kenai.com</a>\nwhich will launch the app (with all it's rather large images) via\nJNLP. If you're curious about the sources, they're on <a href=\n\"http://kenai.com/projects/fxslideshowtest\">kenai</a>. The code is\npretty ugly: I just slapped it together. I'm not proud :-) The code\nfor the map browsing component is in there too. It uses the tile\nserver from <a href=\n\"http://www.openstreetmap.org\">openstreetmap.org</a> (Click and\ndrag with the mouse to move, scroll wheel to zoom). I kinda like\nthe map browsing component, so I'm cleaning up the source and I'll\npush it out to kenai as a separate project sometime soon. \n\n<p>I would have published it earlier in the week, except that\nthere's a bug on Snow Leopard where webstarted apps that use\nfullscreen get a bus error :-( Works fine in fullscreen as a\nregular desktop app, but something weird happens when webstarting.\nWorks fine on all other platforms. I gave up trying to figure out\nwhat was going on and just dropped the fullscreen startup.</p>\n\n",
