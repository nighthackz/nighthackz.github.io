  "body" : "<a href=\"http://java.sun.com/javaone/sf/index.jsp\">JavaOne</a> is\njust a few weeks away and the crunch is already far too intense.\nWe're doing a review of proposed keynote demos tomorrow: it's\neaslly the longest \"cool stuff\" list we've ever had. I don't know\nhow we're going to choose. There's a lot of cool stuff going on,\nand just not enough stage time for most of it. Today is also the\ndue date for deciding the Duke's Choice awards. It's really hard.\nAs much as I've been bitching and moaning about my lack of sleep,\nit's a good problem to have. \n\n<p>We're also ending up with an overdose of competitions. One of\nthe reasons I decided against doing the t-shirt hurling contest\nagain this year is that there were piles of other proposals: I\nwanted to leave room for something new. The big tragedy here is\nthat as a Sun Employee, I can't enter any of them. :-(</p>\n\n",
