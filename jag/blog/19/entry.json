  "body" : "This is the season where we all get inundated with all the\ndifferent versions of Christmas. It's hard to avoid feeling jaded\nand cynical about it all. Years ago I ran into a book called <i>The\nEvolution of Cooperation</i> by Robert Axelrod. It's a wonderful\nbook. In a strong sense, it's the geek version of the message of\nChristmas. It's a very readable Game Theory book that contains a\nprofound message of hope: cooperation is the optimal strategy, not\nconflict. Check it out at <a href=\n\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465021212/ref=nosim/jamesgoslingA\"\n shape=\"rect\">amazon</a>, or better yet, support your local\nbookstore.\n",
