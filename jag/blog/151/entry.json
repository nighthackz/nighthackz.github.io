My 100 year old <a href=\n\"http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jag?entry=my_grandmother_the_zen_master\"\n shape=\"rect\">grandmother</a> died and I got the job of dealing\nwith creating notices and recording stuff. Her name was fine\n(Kar&#243;l&#237;na Margr&#233;t Sveinsd&#243;ttir) since it only\ncontained conventional European accents. But the place she was\nliving when she left Iceland (H&#230;&#240;arenda) and her\ngrandmothers name (Kar&#237;tas &#222;orsteinsd&#243;ttir) were\nproblematic. Enough software failed to handle these that it was\npretty awkward. I won't name names, but I did file bug reports.\n",
