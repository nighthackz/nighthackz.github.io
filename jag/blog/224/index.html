<div class=entry><h1>Contests@JavaOne: a first look</h1>
There are some programming contests at JavaOne this year that you
might want to look at before you come. The details aren't all clear
yet and the web sites aren't finished, but there's enough to get
you started. 

<p>The the slot car track was so popular last year that we've <a
href="http://race.java.sun.com">brought it back</a>. This year the
rules are different: it's a rally rather than a race. There are
waypoints along the track and you have to reach each one "on time".
You lose points for being early or late. The rules and code are on
the site. The top three contestants get <a href=
"http://www.sunspotworld.com/">SunSpots</a> and assorted other
goodies (but you have to be at my keynote on Friday to
collect!).</p>

<p>The <a href="http://greenfoot.org">Greenfoot folks</a> are
running a game-writing contest at <a href=
"http://mygame.java.sun.com">MyGame.java.sun.com</a>. Greenfoot is
a specialized IDE for teaching kids to program that uses
game-writing as a motivation. It's pretty cool. If you're not
interested in entering, you should check out the site anyway
because it contains lots of simple applet games. Right now, it's
mostly games used to test the framework, many are broken - but
that'll change quickly. Like the slot car contest, the top three
contestants get SunSpots and assorted other goodies (and you also
have to be at my keynote on Friday to collect!). We won't be
running the contest finals during my keynote: there's not enough
time do do that and show off all the cool toys...</p>

<p>Then there's the <a href=
"http://java.sun.com/javaone/sf/robots.jsp">RoboSapiens
contest</a>. It turns out that the larger models of these <a href=
"http://www.wowwee.com/robosapien/robo1/robomain.html">popular
toys</a> have ARM9s in them, for which there exists a JavaVM. The
ones you can buy in the street are sealed programmatically, but the
WoWee folks will have a couple of hundred for sale at the show that
are programmable. There will also be a pile in a hands-on lab for
folks to play with and use for writing contest code. The supply
they're bringing for sale is small and will go fast. There were a
pile of logistical problems in getting more to the show, but they
say that they will be making them available for sale (probably
online) sometime after JavaOne.</p>

<blockquote style="font-style: italic">
  I don't know why this is happening, but this year's JavaOne is
  setting a new high for craziness. So frigging much stuff going
  on. Piles of folks killing themselves to put demos together. Too
  much fun. I'll need to sleep for a month.
