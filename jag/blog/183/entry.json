  "body" : "I got through the rest of yesterday with some interesting meetings\nwith customers and the press. A couple of folks who worked with the\nSavaJe phones were showing me the leaderboard app from the slot car\nracing contest running on the phone. If you stopped by the race\ntrack, you would have seen the original app on a big screen by the\ntrack. It's pretty straightforward, but it was still pretty cool\nseeing it running (almost) unchanged on the cell phone. They did\nmake a couple of changes: they scaled down the background image and\nfixed a bug in my networking code that was timing out too\naggressively. \n\n<p>Today is mostly rehearsals for my keynote tomorrow morning -\nwhich is all demos. But they're longer demos than you usually see\nat keynotes, with a lot more code and detail.</p>\n\n<p>This evening is the After Dark party, which promises to be a lot\nof fun. The Mythbusters will be there, mostly doing robotic stuff\n(sorry, no exploding cement trucks in public places). And we're\ndoing the t-shirt hurling contest. Fun with cannons and\nchainsaws.... And the Brazilians doing performance art...</p>\n\n",
