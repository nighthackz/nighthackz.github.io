They're going to be part of the entertainment at the\nAfterDark party, and we were going over things they could do to\nliven up the event. The tragedy is that most of the cool things\nthey do for their show could never be done in a crowded room\nwithout doing some serious harm to the audience. The Fire Marshall\ngets pretty cranky about that sort of thing. But they'll do\nsomething cool. And they'll be doing some color commentary for the\nT-Shirt hurling contest. <br>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center\">\n  <br>\n  <span style=\"font-size: 70%\">Jamie Hyneman, James Gosling, Wendy\n  Yamaguma (the gal that runs JavaOne) and Adam Savage</span>\n</div>\n",
