So, Steve, just in case you ever read my blog:\nThanks. You've made a huge difference to me, the industry, and the\nworld. My house is filled with Apple gear because it is the best,\nand it's the best because of you. You're a hard guy to work with,\nbut your uncompromising insistence on excellence has a huge upside.\nYou probably don't know this, but your daughter Eve went to the\nsame elementary school, in the same grade, as my youngest daughter.\nEve was a good kid to have over for birthday parties. You really\nthrilled the third grade class when you showed up to give an iPhone\ndemo the day after it was announced. I'm not sure what impressed\nthe kids most: the gizmo, or your infectious enthusiasm. It's\nunfortunate that you could never come to any of the father/child\ncampouts: you would have had fun. Happy Trails.\n",
