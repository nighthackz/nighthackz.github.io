<img align=right src='PigWithWings.png'>Another conversation thread floating around the internet these days
is speculation about <a href=
"http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/summaries/2007/December07-summary.html">Oracle
and the future of the JCP</a>. Specifically about this little
nugget from December of 2007: 

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Resolution 1 (proposed by Oracle, seconded by
  BEA)</strong></em></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"It is the sense of the Executive Committee that the JCP
    become an open independent vendor-neutral Standards
    Organization where all members participate on a level playing
    field with the following characteristics:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>members fund development and management expenses</li>

      <li>a legal entity with by-laws, governing body, membership,
      etc.</li>

      <li>a new, simplified IPR Policy that permits the broadest
      number of implementations</li>

      <li>stringent compatibility requirements</li>

      <li>dedicated to promoting the Java programming model<br>

      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Furthermore, the EC shall put a plan in place to make such
    transition as soon as practical with minimal disruption to the
    Java Community."</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>I actually got an email recently that started "When
Oracle starts the Java foundation...". Ethics and consistency
aren't exactly the <b title="Larry, Prince Of Darkness">LPOD</b>'s
reputation: he's famously a fan of a quote attributed to Genghis
Khan: "It's not enough that we win; all others must lose". This
resolution in 2007 was all part of a control game played by Oracle,
no high-minded principles involved at all. Now that they have a
different point of view, it's clear that this resolution being
honored is about as likely as pigs growing wings. 

<p>But Java is likely to be in pretty safe shape. It's a key piece
of technology in too many of Oracle's businesses, so screwing Java
up too badly would hurt them more than almost anyone else. Well....
Mostly. Oracle's universe is defined by the enterprise datacenter.
Stuff outside of the datacenter makes as much sense to the core of
Oracle as bicycles make sense to fish. But when they got Sun and
Java, they got a lot of stuff outside of the datacenter. It <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Does_not_compute">does not
compute</a>.</p>

<p>It's Solaris I'm really fearful for: I wish the <a href=
"http://www.illumos.org/">Illumos</a> folks well, but the data on
Solaris so far is pretty discouraging. If only because the rate at
which key technologists from Sun have been fleeing Oracle's culture
of fear has been so high that there's almost no one left.</p>
