<img align=right src='2005_12_16_09-03-35-531_n2.large.png'>I had a long and fascinating Wednesday with a couple of folks from
Berkeley's new RAD Lab (<a href=
"http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/051215/internet_lab.html?.v=2" shape=
"rect">press</a>, <a href="http://radlab.cs.berkeley.edu/" shape=
"rect">home</a>). While their public decoding of the acronym RAD is
"Reliable Adaptive Distributed", they also care deeply about the
more common decoding: "Rapid Application Development". The
conversation was all over the map, but a major thread was about the
design tension between <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language" shape=
"rect">scripting languages</a> and <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language" shape=
"rect">strongly typed</a> <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_programming_language"
shape="rect">general purpose</a> languages. 

<p style="text-align: left">Over the years I've used and created a
wide variety of scripting languages, and in general, I'm a big fan
of them. When the project that Java came out of first started, I
was originally planning to do a scripting language. But a number of
forces pushed me away from that.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">The biggest was concerns about
performance and the inevitability of scale. I can't remember how
often I've had experiences where someone has proudly shown me some
system they've put together using the scripting-language-du-jour:
things like an Adobe Illustrator clone written entirely in
PostScript; a satellite groundstation diagnostic system written as
TECO macros; a BASIC compiler written as Emacs macros; fourier
transform algorithms in PostScript... This list is endless. They
always ended with "this is so cool, but I'd like it to be as fast
as {C,Assembler,whatever}". People get into scripting to quickly
build small quick things, but they often grow far beyond where the
initial concept started.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">Another was about testing, reliability
and maintainability. One of the common properties of scripting
languages is brevity. This tends to lead to omitting declarations,
weak typing and ignoring errors. Generally a great thing if you're
quickly putting something together; not so great if you want checks
and balances that crosscheck correctness.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">Another is generality. Many scripting
languages get a good part of their coolness from being specialized
- by having key functionality wired into their hearts. A good
example is perl, with it's great regular expressions and hash
tables. But this drags in a number of issues, chief among them
being: what if you want to do something outside the language's area
of specialization? Many modern apps need to do exactly that, so one
of two things happen: languages get used for wildly inappropriate
things (fourier transforms in PostScript), or a collection of
languages get used together (which can make it very hard for any
one person to understand them, and interconnections can be a
nightmare).</p>

<p style="text-align: left">The list of interesting questions is
really long, this blog entry could easily be a book (that I'll
never have time to write). This hardly scratches the surface. The
number of potential PhD thesis topics is huge.</p>
