His impact was enormous, and\noutside the tech world, mostly unknown - but very much felt. C\nunderpins everything. My whole career has grown out of C and Unix.\nWow. \n\n<p>For most engineers working today, it's hard to understand the\neuphoria I felt in the 70s when a programming language finally came\nalong that I (and everyone else) could use to move up from writing\nin assembler to a real programming language. We could do everything\nwe needed to do to write all the low-level bits of systems. Before\nC, programming languages just weren't up to the task: the overheads\nwere just too large. The sophistication of systems was really held\nback by the difficulty of writing large pieces of software in\nassembler.
