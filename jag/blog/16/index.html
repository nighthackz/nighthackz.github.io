<div class=entry><h1>Hell on the road to Prague</h1>
The segments of my trip on Monday and Tuesday of this week set a
new low in my corporate travel experience. This is the second time
I've written up this little history: the first got eaten in a
curious email disaster. It's just as well since I wrote up the
first after several very stiff drinks at Charles du Gaulle airport.
I'm writing this up partly so I don't forget, and partly to explain
why I never made it to Prague to speak at the TechDays conference
and visit the NetBeans engineering team. I'd like to apologize to
all of the folks in Prague who were expecting me to show up. I
tried. But some cosmic force had other ideas...

<p>It started off well enough. I landed in Paris on time. Eric Mahe
picked me up and we headed off to the Bouyges Telecom event where I
did the required schmoozing and took part in a press panel session.
Lots of very cool java cell phone demos: they've deployed DoCoMo's
i-mode system. I ended up getting a ride to the airport with
Takeshi Natsuno, the fellow who's in charge of DoCoMo's i-mode
strategy, who also was the founder of i-mode within DoCoMo. We had
a great conversation on the way.</p>

<p>I finally get to the checkin counter where I'm told that I need
a Visa. I found this hard to believe since I had been to Prague
previously, without the need for a visa. The agent is quite
insistent, as only a Parisian can be :-( So I leave the checkin
counter moderately annoyed, but sure that this is just a bit of
confusion. I phoned Rosenbluth, the travel agents, and they
confirmed the need for a visa. My stress level ticks up a couple of
notches: if they could figure this out now, why the hell didn't
they catch it when they put together the itinerary? It's a part of
their job! I tried checking in again, lining up for a different
agent, to see if I could slide past. No dice. This one tracked down
the documentation for me to read and weep: yes, Canadians do need
Visas. The fine to the airline for letting a person without a visa
onto the plane was 9000 euros. I'd have to pay a similar fine, plus
pay for the flight back. To make it worse, it contained the phrase
"visa's must be obtained in the country of residence". The
Rosenbluth folks were pretty unhelpful. They advised me to call the
Visa Network folks. They couldn't say much either. They had
essentially no information on Czech visa requirements.</p>

<p>All through this I was calling the folks in Prague (mostly
Shelly Haggarty) to let them know what was going on. It was now
6:30pm. Too late to do anything. I was not going to make it for the
keynote speech I was supposed to give the next morning. I checked
in to the nearest hotel, the airport Sheraton, which was right
there. I decided to try going to the Czech visa office the next
morning to plead for a visa. I asked our folks in Prague to write
up a letter for me to take with me to explain that I was needed in
Prague in short order. I called up Rosenbluth. I got them to book
me on the 12:55 flight the next day. This would get me there in
time to give my keynote at the end of the day. Reggie Hutcherson
rescheduled his talk to fill the gap that I would be missing
from.</p>

<p>I had a plan. I could sleep.</p>

<p>Up at the crack of dawn. Check out. Head in to Paris on the
express train. Easy: the hotel was on top of the train station. The
address I was given was on Boulevard Haussmann. I couldn't tell
which end of the boulevard the address was on, so I left extra
early to spend some time searching. This was a good thing, since I
guessed wrong. I ended up doing a 10 block mad dash from one end of
blvd Haussmann to the other. But no worries: I got to the office
just before it opened. Argh!! I discovered that the address I was
given was for the Czech Embassy, and the visa office was in the
Consulate. On the other side of down. Fuck. Mad dash on the Metro
(what a wonderful system!) to rue Bonaparte. Mad dash a few blocks
to where the person at the Embassy had marked the position of the
Consulate. Fuck. Looking at the numbers on the buildings, it was
clear that the X was totally in the wrong place. Mad dash another 6
blocks and victory: there was the consulate. And it contained the
Visa office! It was now 9:45, my plane was to leave at 12:55.</p>

<p>Shit. The visa office is packed, mostly with Turkish laborers
doing the migrant labor thing. No one spoke English, and I spoke
little French, but the folks in the office had no problem telling
me that I had to fill out this very detailed 3 page form before I
could even talk to an agent. I did ask "how long does this process
take?" to which I got the answer "5 working days". For some reason,
I didn't just give up and walk out. I plodded on. While I was
filling out this form-from-the-depths-of-hell, a lady from the
office came out and asked "Vous etes Canadians?" (are you Canadian)
followed by some stuff that I had a hard time following, but I
roughly translated as "I've just been yelled at by three levels up
the bureaucratic chain-of-command to get you through here as fast
as possible". Instant rocket ride. They took the letter from our
folks in Prague that had been faxed to me in the hotel. I don't
know what was done by whoever in the Prague office: but it worked.
They were falling over themselves to get me my visa
instantaneously. Everyone else waiting in line was miffed.</p>

<p>Ooops. A snag. They needed to have a photograph of me so that
they could make the papers required for me to get past the border
guards. Another mad dash through the streets of Paris to a place
that took ID photos. There was a line! Groan. I get my photo. Mad
dash back.</p>

<p>A frenzy of typing, stamping, sticking and laminating ensues
(who'd have thought that a Visa would be so physically complicated
to put together?). I pay the 96 euro fee and dash out of there with
my brand new visa. It's 10:50. 65 minutes to get the Visa! It's
amazing what a motivated bureaucracy can do!</p>

<p>Mad dash to the St Germain du Pres station, Metro to les Halles,
onto the express train to Charles du Gaulle. I've made it! The
express train is much faster than yesterday's taxi ride. I get to
the airport with time to spare. Up to the checkin counter. I pass
the "do you have a visa?" test. Success! Many bonus points for the
folks in Prague! I was so happy!</p>

<p>Then the checkin agent frowns. Brows wrinkle. My reservation is
in order, but the ticket is not. I'm told to go to the ticket sales
office to straighten thing out. It's about 11:45. Fuck! Piss! Shit!
Mad dash to the sales office. Long line. One agent. Trying to skip
the line gets me a stiff "Guardez la Queue!". I call Rosenbluth to
see if they can straighten out the ticket. They confirm that the
ticket is indeed messed up. If I understood right, yesterday's
Rosenbluth agent had correctly changed my reservation, and had
changed my ticket to the new flight and time, but had gotten the
date wrong on the ticket. For some reason, fixing this was complex.
(It's also insane that the airline systems have such a weak link
between tickets and reservations that they have to change the two
independently! These problems shouldn't be possible! But I won't go
there...). The Rosenbluth agent is madly typing to fix the ticket.
I madly dash back to the checkin agent (I love cell phones! My
international roaming charges are going to be enormous!). The
Rosenbluth agent says the change is complex. Wants to talk to the
checkin agent. Checkin agent refuses to talk to Rosenbluth agent.
She's very insistent on this point. She does some typing and utters
the fateful phrase "I'm sorry monsieur, but your flight has
closed".</p>

<p>My stress level jumped way way over the top. It's a wonder my
head didn't explode and leave a bloody mess all over the building.
I'm devastated. So damn close to success. Such a struggle to get
the visa. And then this. I stumble away and stand shaking. I still
have the cellphone in my hand. The Rosenbluth agent asks "shall I
book you on the next flight to Prague?". I can't answer. I hang up
the phone. Life is just too damned short for this shit. All I can
think of is that I'm supposed to be joining my wife for
Thanksgiving vacation in two days. I completely give up. After all
that, it's not in me to face another round with Air France and
Rosenbluth. And a lot of my time in Prague has been eaten up in
this bullshit. I decide that the only path to regaining my sanity
is to start my vacation early.</p>

<p>Being a complete glutton for punishment, I call up Rosenbluth to
get me the new reservation and cancel the intermediate
reservations. But, in truth, I'm really calling to give them
another opportunity to fuck me over again, which they are only to
happy to do! (but I don't know this yet). They get me an economy
class reservation on an Alitalia flight leaving in a few hours.
Still shaking, but starting to breath again, I head over to the
Alitalia desk. It's in a different building so I get a nice long
walk to cool myself off :-(</p>

<p>Once more at a checkin desk. Once more the checkin agent frowns.
Once more, the checkin agent sends me off to the sales desk. There
they explain that the ticket is all wrong. Because of the way the
original itinerary was done, this flight can't just be added to it:
it has to be a new itinerary (somehow incomprehensibly linked to
the way an attempt was made to apply the payment for the Air France
ticket to the Alitalia ticket). The Rosenbluth agent had apparently
set it up as a separate itinerary, but had done it wrong. The
ticked needed to be "one-way". As a one-way, it couldn't be economy
class. For some reason "one-way economy" is a non-existent concept.
It had to be business class. Other things were messed up, so rather
than calling Rosenbluth to have them fix it, I just paid for the
flight with my credit card. It actually wasn't as expensive as I
had guessed. It will be on my expense report. I just couldn't face
another call to Rosenbluth.</p>

<p>Rosenbluth-free ticket in hand, I finally checked in, got
through security, headed for the Alitalia lounge (which I got a
pass to since I had just bought a full-fare business class
ticket!). I took serious advantage of the free drinks. Got on the
plane. And had an uneventful flight and got safely to my hotel.</p>

<p>I feel <i>much</i> better now.</p>
