Pretty frightening! Don't\nworry, I'm growing it back as fast as I can. I had to cut it off\nlast Sunday because last Monday I went in for <a href=\n\"http://sleepsurgery.com/maxil.html\">surgery</a> to correct a\nrather severe case of <a href=\n\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_apnea#Obstructive_Sleep_Apnea\">obstructive\nsleep apnea</a>. \n\n<p>I generally stay away from posting personal stuff on my work\nblog, but the blog-o-sphere is a great place for conspiracy\ntheorists and worrywarts. I've only been out for a week and I've\nalready received all kinds of odd mail. No, I'm not off pouting\nabout Sun's Open Source Strategy: I'm really happy we're finally\ngetting it done (the only thing I'm unhappy about is how many\ncomplexities there are to take care of - don't worry, we'll get it\ndone). No, I'm not job hunting: Sun is fun again!</p>\n\n<p>I probably won't be back at work until after New Years. I've got\na lot of healing to do: four large saw cuts in my skull have left\nme pretty grumpy. Then there's the steel framework holding my skull\ntogether while it all heals (no pictures, I promise). The fun part\nis that for this kinda stuff, serious pain killers come in\njugs.</p>\n\n",
