<td valign=top class=content><div class=entry><h1>Comments around Oracle v Google</h1>
There's been a lot of chatter about the Oracle v Google case,
sometimes putting words into my mouth. I can't go into much detail
because it is an ongoing court case where I'm likely to be a
witness. But there are a few points I feel I should restate that
have been said before: 

<ul>
  <li>My "Google totally slimed Sun" comment was a personal moral
  opinion. Not my guess at a legal result, or a legal opinion at
  all - I am not a lawyer and would never pretend to be.</li>

  <li>I certainly think that the patent system is broken, but the
  system is what it is. The original basic theory makes sense to
  me, but what it's evolved into doesn't. At Sun we had a near
  death experience after losing a case with IBM, after that we
  realized we had to play the game, no matter how bogus.</li>

  <li>The wide implications of Oracle winning the copyright case
  are pretty disturbing. But that's a practical opinion. How it
  will go in the legal system is anyone's guess. It extends far
  beyond Oracle: developers everywhere use APIs defined by many
  other entities. I hate to think of what an emerging "copyright
  troll" industry might be.</li>

  <li>A lot of what I've read gets really hyperbolic on the
  possibilities of the industrial meltdown that Oracle could
  conceivably cause. Despite my well-known opinions on Oracle, they
  wouldn't do any of the nightmare scenarios that some have
  imagined: such a meltdown would not be in their own self
  interest. They have actually been unexpectedly good stewards of
  Java (although less so of Solaris).</li>

  <li>The issue has always been interoperability. It's one of the
  major aspects that has made the Java community thrive. The
  freedom of developers to expect their programs to work has always
  been at tension with the freedom of platform providers to do
  whatever they please. At Sun, we always sided with
  developers.</li>

  <li>The Java patents were used by Sun as a tool to enforce
  interoperability: follow the spec, you can use them for free. A
  good result for developers derived from a bogus patent
  system.</li>
</ul>
