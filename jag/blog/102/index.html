I get interviewed by the press fairly often. Every now and then,
one of them gets a few things wrong. ComputerWire just put out one
titled "Threat to 10 million Java Goal from Microsoft, Says
Gosling" that doesn't correctly get across what I meant. The title
of the article is somewhat sensationalist. He got the quote from me
correct: "The biggest problem is going to be competition from
Redmond," but that was just a general statement that for everyone
in the computer business, in essentially every area, Microsoft is
<i>the</i> big competitive question.

<p>The big error, though, is in this part:</p>

<blockquote>
  While welcoming Java's pervasiveness, Gosling appears cool to a
  branding campaign. "There's a part of me that likes being taken
  for granted. One of the goals I had as an engineer was for the
  technology I build to be completely transparent. If I pull out a
  cell phone and have to boot-up the JVM [Java Virtual Machine],
  that would be bad,"
</blockquote>I am not at all cool to the branding campaign, I think
it's a <i>great</i> thing to be doing. What I was talking about
when I made the taken-out-of-context quotes is that as an engineer,
a major goal of any technology I work on is for it to be as easy to
use as possible. I try to ensure that nothing gets in the way of
the end user accomplishing their task. The technology should be
transparent. From my <i>engineering</i> point of view, a perfect
piece of technology is one that does its job without the user being
aware of it. No fuss. No muss. Just accomplish the task at hand.

<p>This has <b>nothing</b> to do with brand awareness.</p>
