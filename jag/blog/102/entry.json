  "body" : "I get interviewed by the press fairly often. Every now and then,\none of them gets a few things wrong. ComputerWire just put out one\ntitled \"Threat to 10 million Java Goal from Microsoft, Says\nGosling\" that doesn't correctly get across what I meant. The title\nof the article is somewhat sensationalist. He got the quote from me\ncorrect: \"The biggest problem is going to be competition from\nRedmond,\" but that was just a general statement that for everyone\nin the computer business, in essentially every area, Microsoft is\n<i>the</i> big competitive question.\n\n<p>The big error, though, is in this part:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  While welcoming Java's pervasiveness, Gosling appears cool to a\n  branding campaign. \"There's a part of me that likes being taken\n  for granted. One of the goals I had as an engineer was for the\n  technology I build to be completely transparent. If I pull out a\n  cell phone and have to boot-up the JVM [Java Virtual Machine],\n  that would be bad,\"\n</blockquote>I am not at all cool to the branding campaign, I think\nit's a <i>great</i> thing to be doing. What I was talking about\nwhen I made the taken-out-of-context quotes is that as an engineer,\na major goal of any technology I work on is for it to be as easy to\nuse as possible. I try to ensure that nothing gets in the way of\nthe end user accomplishing their task. The technology should be\ntransparent. From my <i>engineering</i> point of view, a perfect\npiece of technology is one that does its job without the user being\naware of it. No fuss. No muss. Just accomplish the task at hand.\n\n<p>This has <b>nothing</b> to do with brand awareness.</p>\n\n",
