  "body" : "I got to spend Thursday and Friday last week hanging out at the Jet\nPropulsion Labs in Pasadena. The home of <i>real</i> rocket\nscientists. The big excitement there is the two MERs (Mars\nExploration Rovers) that are on their way to Mars now. Check it out\nat jpl.nasa.gov. This photo is from the viewing gallery above the\n\"Mars Room\" where mission controllers are practicing all phases of\nthe flight. The big device in the lower part of the picture is the\nlander itself. Above it is the rover, just after a practice\nlanding. They're doing everything they can to make sure that at\nleast one of the missions is successful.\n",
