Except that I cheated: the dates are actually in the body\nof the entry that BlogEd publishes to Roller - I whacked my blog\ntemplate to get rid of the dates that come from Roller. The only\nway this cheat is visible is in the calendar on the side: if you\nclick on dates you see the dates that Roller understands, rather\nthan the accurate dates. \n\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">The problem ended up being with the\nmetaweblog API and its realization in Roller: while Roller allows\nthe publication date to be set manually through a web page, there's\nno access to that through metaweblog. Which leads to <a href=\n\"http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/10/15/dive.html\" shape=\"rect\">all\nthe thrashing about other blog APIs</a>, like <a href=\n\"http://www.atomenabled.org/\" shape=\"rect\">Atom</a>. I'm <i>so</i>\nlooking forward to something that works...</p>\n\n",
