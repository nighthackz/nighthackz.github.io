<td valign=top class=content><div class=entry><h1>Open sourcing Java</h1>
There's been a lot of churn lately over open letters from IBM and
others calling for Sun to open source Java. Rather than try to
respond to everyone individually, I'll try to respond to a pile of
questions here: 

<ul>
  <li>Some have asked why IBM is sending open letters, rather than
  talking to us directly: asking if this isn't rather
  kindergarten-ish. Well, yes: it does appear that way.</li>

  <li>Some have asked what IBM would get if Java were open-sourced:
  doesn't IBM already have the source? Again yes, they do have the
  source. It's also true that anyone can get the source. The major
  restriction is that if folks want to redistrubute their changes,
  they have to pass the test suite. Which means that about the only
  thing that they could get from liberalization is to be able to
  skip testing.</li>

  <li>Some of IBM's statements have essentially distilled down to
  "we'd love to help: open source java so that we can". This has
  led to questions about whether or not IBM has been able to help.
  The answer is that they have. They're one of the strongest
  participants in the Java Community Process. Their participation
  over the years has been substantial, and we're very thankful for
  it. For example, IBM was the major mover that led to the creation
  of the Swing API to replace the AWT api. They contributed many
  engineers to the Swing team. Viewing that time in hindsight, it
  is more than slightly ironic that these days they're endorsing
  SWT, which is essentially a clone of the AWT architecture, which
  they had strongly condemmed back when the decision to create
  Swing was being debated.</li>

  <li>Some have asked when, given IBM's apparent zeal for open
  source, DB2 and WebSpere will be open sourced: ask them, not me -
  it does seem unlikely.</li>

  <li>
    Most of the comments I've heard from folks about open sourciing
    Java have been negative. Hmmm... Not so much negative as
    concerned: Developers value Java's cross platform
    interoperability and reliability. They're afraid that if Java
    is open-sourced then someone will try to fragment the community
    by creating incompatible versions of Java and ignore the
    community process, just like Microsoft did. Microsoft did a lot
    of damage to the community and many developers strongly do not
    want that to happen again. 

    <p>This is a big issue for us. <i>If</i> we do something to
    make Java even more open-source than it is already, having
    safeguards to protect the developer community will be something
    we pay a lot of attention to. Carefully done, open-sourcing
    could actually promote interoperability by making it easier for
    disparate groups to align behind one code base.</p>
