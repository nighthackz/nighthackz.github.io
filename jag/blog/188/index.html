<td valign=top class=content><div class=entry><h1>Boiling oceans</h1>
For the last couple of months I've been involved with stuff at work
that didn't make good blog material. I've done a lot of helping out
on project reviews and kibbitzing on planning. At this point in the
process, where we've got a pretty clear picture of the shape and
direction of things, I'm pretty happy with how it's all turned out.
A tough process, but an important one to go through. 

<p>Several times I couldn't help but think of one of my favorite
principles of engineering that is all-too-often forgotten:</p>

<blockquote>
  <b>A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.</b> 

  <div style="font-style: italic; text-align: right">
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lao-tzu">Lao-tzu</a>
  </div>
</blockquote>While this quote may be so commonplace as to be trite,
it is too often forgotten. There is a <a href=
"http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/24004.html">note about this
quotation</a> that seems especially relevant: 

<blockquote>
  Although this is the popular form of this quotation, a more
  correct translation from the original Chinese would be "The
  journey of a thousand miles begins beneath one's feet." Rather
  than emphasizing the first step, Lau Tzu regarded action as
  something that arises naturally from stillness. Another potential
  phrasing would be "Even the longest journey must begin where you
  stand." [note by Michael Moncur, September 01, 2004]
</blockquote>At Sun we use the term "boiling oceans" to refer to
trying to do something impossibly hard all at once. It's an
especially silly thing to do if all you really want is a kettle of
hot water for tea. Engineering projects too often fall into the
trap of over-generalizing, trying to solve problems that folks
might concievably have, building things so large and elaborate on
day 1 that they never get off the ground. It is always better to
start with a first step. Then a second. And on... 

<p>One of the big sources of the problem is confusing a vision with
a to-do list. Implicit in taking the first step in a journey of a
thousand miles is that you have to have some clue about where
you're going. That's the role of a vision for a project. It's
seductive to take the vision and turn it into a to-do list. But
grand visions lead to insane to-do lists. The art of breaking them
down into manageable steps can be a tough one.</p>

<p>Visions are notoriously slippery things. Your vision of a good
place to go, of the right target for a project, is heavily
dependent on the time and place where you are standing and looking
out. With every step on a journey of a thousand miles you see
things from a slightly different vantage point. Your vision
adjusts. Your goal shifts. For me, that is one of the most exciting
aspects of a project: I start out with an intent, with a vision of
where I hope to end up, but the true destination unfolds in
fascinating and surprising ways.</p>
