  "body" : "A while ago I bought a copy of KidPix for my 5 year old daughter\n(Kelsey). I had bought one years ago for my (now) 14 year old\ndaughter (Kate). They both loved it. I installed the new copy on my\nwife's iBook, since she leaves it set up by the kitchen. Kelsey\nloves KidPix so much that she took over my wife's computer. When my\nwife wanted to read her email, Kelsey wouldn't let her, delivering\na lecture on how my wife had to \"share\". Needless to say, this\ndidn't go over very well. To restore family harmony, I trotted off\nto the Apple store and bought an eMac... Of course, my 14 year old\nhas had a computer in her room for quite a few years. It's pretty\naged by now.\n\n<p>I had become a statistic. There was a fascinating Report that\ncame out from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting called <a\nhref=\"http://www.cpb.org/ed/resources/connected/\" shape=\n\"rect\">Connected to the Future</a>, <i>A Report on Children's\nInternet Use</i>. The internet is becoming such a big part of\nchildren's lives \"65 percent of American children ages 2-17 now use\nthe Internet from home, school, or some other location\" and \"78\npercent of children live in homes in which either they or a parent\nuse the Internet from home\". These are wonderful numbers,\nespecially the ones later on where they analyze how the Internet is\nbeing used: far from being dominated by games, Education and\nExploration are the big areas.</p>\n\n",
