<td valign=top class=content><div class=entry><h1>KidPix Rules</h1>
A while ago I bought a copy of KidPix for my 5 year old daughter
(Kelsey). I had bought one years ago for my (now) 14 year old
daughter (Kate). They both loved it. I installed the new copy on my
wife's iBook, since she leaves it set up by the kitchen. Kelsey
loves KidPix so much that she took over my wife's computer. When my
wife wanted to read her email, Kelsey wouldn't let her, delivering
a lecture on how my wife had to "share". Needless to say, this
didn't go over very well. To restore family harmony, I trotted off
to the Apple store and bought an eMac... Of course, my 14 year old
has had a computer in her room for quite a few years. It's pretty
aged by now.

<p>I had become a statistic. There was a fascinating Report that
came out from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting called <a
href="http://www.cpb.org/ed/resources/connected/" shape=
"rect">Connected to the Future</a>, <i>A Report on Children's
Internet Use</i>. The internet is becoming such a big part of
children's lives "65 percent of American children ages 2-17 now use
the Internet from home, school, or some other location" and "78
percent of children live in homes in which either they or a parent
use the Internet from home". These are wonderful numbers,
especially the ones later on where they analyze how the Internet is
being used: far from being dominated by games, Education and
Exploration are the big areas.</p>
