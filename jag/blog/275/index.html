My keynote this morning went off flawlessly. You can <a href=
"http://java.sun.com/javaone/sf/media_shell.jsp?id=sgs4">watch it
on UStream</a>. I'd like to thank everyone who contributed: The
demos were all incredibly inspirational. I was in awe of every one
of them. The main hall at Moscone was packed. The production crew
was totally perfect, despite all the re-arranging of the plan. And
the Sun crew were their usual wonderful selves. 

<p>My keynote is easy. Everybody else doing talks at JavaOne has to
figure out what to say. I poke around the community and grab stuff.
There's so much cool stuff being done that the hardest part of
putting the toy show together is picking. I just have to stand back
in awe and ask a few inane questions.</p>

<p>Controlling the most complex instrument ever made by mankind....
(the Large Hadron Collider) Surfing a constellation of satellites
around mars and mining their data... A pen as a computing
platform... The realtime stuff becoming mainstream....
Instrumenting the world... Another generation of smart cards... And
smart cars... Massive graphical acceleration on a cell phone...
Killer massively multiplayer games... Great web infrastructure
tools for creating and introspecting... "the network is the
computer" Hah! =&gt; "the network is the world"</p>

<p>But the best part was helping to give John Gage his well
deserved lifetime achievement award.</p>

<p>Now it's time for a beach and a beer.</p>
