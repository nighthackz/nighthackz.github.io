  "body" : "My keynote this morning went off flawlessly. You can <a href=\n\"http://java.sun.com/javaone/sf/media_shell.jsp?id=sgs4\">watch it\non UStream</a>. I'd like to thank everyone who contributed: The\ndemos were all incredibly inspirational. I was in awe of every one\nof them. The main hall at Moscone was packed. The production crew\nwas totally perfect, despite all the re-arranging of the plan. And\nthe Sun crew were their usual wonderful selves. \n\n<p>My keynote is easy. Everybody else doing talks at JavaOne has to\nfigure out what to say. I poke around the community and grab stuff.\nThere's so much cool stuff being done that the hardest part of\nputting the toy show together is picking. I just have to stand back\nin awe and ask a few inane questions.</p>\n\n<p>Controlling the most complex instrument ever made by mankind....\n(the Large Hadron Collider) Surfing a constellation of satellites\naround mars and mining their data... A pen as a computing\nplatform... The realtime stuff becoming mainstream....\nInstrumenting the world... Another generation of smart cards... And\nsmart cars... Massive graphical acceleration on a cell phone...\nKiller massively multiplayer games... Great web infrastructure\ntools for creating and introspecting... \"the network is the\ncomputer\" Hah! =&gt; \"the network is the world\"</p>\n\n<p>But the best part was helping to give John Gage his well\ndeserved lifetime achievement award.</p>\n\n<p>Now it's time for a beach and a beer.</p>\n\n",
