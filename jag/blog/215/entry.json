Thanks everyone!\n\n<p>One of the odd little email debate threads has been about the\nt-shirt I'm wearing in the photograph used in the <a href=\n\"http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2007/02/21/tech-20070221.html\">CBC\nnews article</a>. It's my <a href=\n\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Steadman\">Ralph Steadman</a>/<a\nhref=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_S._Thompson\">Hunter\nThompson</a> shirt that reads \"When the going gets Weird\" on the\nfront, and \"the weird turn pro\" on the back. Very appropriate given\nhow crazy the early years were, especially <a href=\n\"https://duke.dev.java.net/green/\">pre-1995</a>. Thanks Mike, Ed,\nPatrick, Chris, Jon, Craig, Al, Bob, Dave, Joe, Don, Faye, Cindy,\nChuck and Sheueling.</p>\n\n",
