But finally, it's done: the winners are\nPeter Moore (Australia), Ronald Smith (USA) and Oscar Guandique\n(San Salvadore). To avoid spoiling the fun, I won't describe their\nentries until after JavaOne. But they're all pretty cool. \n\n<p>In general, judging was harder this year: there were more and\nbetter entries. The entrants generally had a firmer grip on the\nlaws of physics. And there were a lot more international entries.\nThere were a couple of cool ones that involved explosives that I\nthought would be pretty safe, but we couldn't get the folks\nresponsible for safety to calm down. Then there was the one that\ninvolved (among other things) hiring a dozen naked cheerleaders: we\ncouldn't figure out if it was even legal, but we had a great time\ntalking about it.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to everyone who entered, and good luck to the\nfinalists!</p>\n\n<p>To see what they build, you'll have to come to <a href=\n\"http://java.sun.com/javaone/\" shape=\"rect\">JavaOne</a>.</p>\n\n",
