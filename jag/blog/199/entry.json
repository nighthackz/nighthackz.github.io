There ought to be a better way. But contribution agreements\nare remarkable common. Take a look at the one that the <a href=\n\"http://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt\">Apache Project</a> uses.\nIt's even longer than ours. They are an inevitable consequence of\nthe way that the laws work. They should be changed, but it'll take\na long time to bring the laws into the modern era. In the meantime,\nthe laws are what they are. We've worked pretty hard to come up\nwith the simplest scheme that fulfils the legal requirements.\n",
