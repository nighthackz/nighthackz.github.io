<img align=right src='isis_web2.jpg'>I've now been tagged not <a href=
"http://weblogs.java.net/blog/timboudreau/archive/2007/01/tag_and_im_it.html">once</a>,
but <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/richgreen/">twice</a> in the game
of blog-tag that's been going on. It's clearly time to get it over
with, so here are five things you probably don't know about me: 

<ol>
  <li>When I was a kid my favorite place to play was my
  grandfathers shop and "boneyard". The boneyard was a few acres
  next to the shop where he parked all of his old (dead) farm
  equipment. It's history stretched back to about 1910 and had
  several slowly decaying (but grand) steam tractors. They were my
  favorites. The shop had a full set of blacksmithing tools. Lots
  of fun!</li>

  <li>My first job was cleaning the sidewalks at a <a href=
  "http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=calgary,+canada&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=18&amp;ll=51.086539,-114.103548&amp;spn=0.002271,0.005826&amp;t=k&amp;om=1">small
  strip mall</a> in Calgary. My favorite shop there was the only
  one who was never my custormer: a baker named Seebe Borge (I hope
  I got his name right). I kept trying to convince him to pay me to
  shovel the sidewalks, and he kept saying no, but he'd regularly
  hand me half a loaf of bread, fresh out of the oven, covered in
  obscene quantities of butter, sugar and cinammon. He'd eat the
  other half. Perfect food when standing outside watching the snow
  fall.</li>

  <li>Before I discovered computers, I wanted to be a forest warden
  for the National Parks Service.</li>

  <li>My first experience with computing was building a machine to
  play tic-tac-toe for a science fair. I built it out of old
  telephone relays and television parts that I obtained by dumpster
  diving (I could never afford new anything). The amusing bit was
  that the TVs were all vacuum tube machines that didn't have
  anything like a low voltage power supply usable by the relays. So
  I ran the relays on 300V, which often got exciting :-)</li>

  <li>My first computing job was writing software to process data
  from the <a href=
  "http://aurora.phys.ucalgary.ca/isis2/index.html">ISIS II
  satellite</a>. The picture on the right is the machine I worked
  on, a PDP-8/I with 8K of RAM (eventually 12K). The pairs of white
  circles are DECtape drives that the OS swapped on (no disk!). To
  the left is a pair of 9 track tape drives, and to the left of
  them in the blue cabinet is the analog tape drive where we read
  the raw satellite data from. The display used for photography was
  on the right, just off the screen. It had a phenominal 2Kx2K
  resolution - which was hard given that the framebuffer was 4K of
  RAM from the main memory. It was 6 bits/pixel, 12 bits/word,
  hence 8K pixels or 4 scan lines in the framebuffer. We could
  stear the 2Kx4 pixels up and down on the screen, which had a
  camera attached to it. It took quite a while to pass enough data
  through to get a full frame.</li>
</ol>So, who should I tag? I'll start with <a href=
"http://blogs.sun.com/brewin/">Bob Brewin</a> and <a href=
"http://blogs.sun.com/tpm/">Tim Marsland</a>, the co-software-CTOs
at Sun, neither of which have been doing enough blogging. My boss,
<a href=
"http://blogs.sun.com/prague/entry/czech_java_user_group_first">Laurie
Tolson</a>, who still hasn't started blogging. I should tag a
couple more, but these will cause me enough trouble for now.
