<td valign=top class=content><div class=entry><h1>The Black Hole Theory of Design</h1>
The past few weeks have been pretty entertaining: there's the final
crunch to getting JDK6 out the door (with the side-thrill of
coordinating with the tea-leaf-reading exercise that is Windows
Vista), bringing closure to the open source debate, and the most
fun: figuring out the plan for JDK7. This last is the geek version
of writing up a Christmas Present wish list. 

<p>The list is mostly being put together by <a href=
"http://blogs.sun.com/dannycoward">Danny Coward</a> and <a href=
"http://blogs.sun.com/mr">Mark Reinhold</a>, with a lot of
kibbitzing from a cast of thousands. We do surveys of partners,
fold in statistics from the <a href=
"http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/index.jsp">bug voting system</a>,
stir up with our own opinions and then run the JCP debate.</p>

<p>There's an entertaining little firestorm going on over <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_%28computer_science%29">closures</a>.
<a href="http://gafter.blogspot.com">Neal Gafter</a>, <a href=
"http://blogs.sun.com/gbracha">Gilad Bracha</a>, <a href=
"http://blogs.sun.com/ahe">Peter Ah&#233;</a> and many more are
fighting it out. The really heated debate is all in email and I'm
incredibly far behind in reading it (by several hundred
messages).</p>

<p>I have somewhat mixed feelings about closures: they are pretty
complicated. But they're an instance of what I think of as the
<b>Black Hole Theory of Design</b>. I have a really strong memory
from years ago of Guy Steele saying roughly "<i>Lisp is a Black
Hole: if you try to design something that's not Lisp, but like
Lisp, you'll find that the gravitational forces on the design will
suck it into the Black Hole, and it will become Lisp</i>". [Guy
doesn't actually remember making this remark, but he does say it
sounds like the kind of flip comment he would make; I could also be
totally mis-remembering who said it, but I haven't found any quote
like it through Google].</p>

<p>Closures feel to me like one of these design Black Holes. When
inner classes were designed, we wanted to avoid the complexity of
closures. But this brought about oddness and tension of it's own
that has left me less than happy with inner classes. So, should we
just give in to the force of gravity and go the rest of the way?
The debate's afoot. It's going to be an entertaining year.</p>
