  "body" : "I'm in Tokyo this week for <a href=\n\"http://jp.sun.com/company/events/techdays/\">Tech Days</a>. We've\ngot a crew of folks doing detailed talks all over the Java and\nSolaris technology landscape. I'll be doing a keynote, the opening\nof NetBeans day on Tuesday, and a pile of customer visits. If\nyou're in the neighborhood, please come. \n\n<p>The past couple of weeks have been pretty cool.</p>\n\n<p>I was at OOPSLA in Montreal and participated in a panel session\non Simula. I learned OO programming writing Simula programs, and\neven did some bug fixing in the CDC 6000/7000 Simula compiler - the\nfirst real compiler I ever saw the innards of. Ole Lehrmann Madsen\nfrom Aarhus University was there: he was one of the three\noriginators of Simula. Unfortunately, the other two, Ole-Johan Dahl\nand Kristen Nygaard, passed away recently. I also got to meet one\nof the members of the team that wrote the original CDC compiler -\nbut with my leaky brain I forgot his name!</p>\n\n<p>I also had the pleasure of getting an award from Concordia\nUniversity, which was very nice. But the real thrill was meeting\none of the folks that worked on the photometers on the <a href=\n\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISIS_(satellite)\">ISIS-II\nsatellite</a>. My first software job was writing code to manipulate\ndata from them.</p>\n\n<p>I also got to swing through Ottawa for the <a href=\n\"http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/story.html?id=ba05911b-fecc-4208-9fdd-502bd4a5b1d5&amp;k=5241\">Order\nof Canada</a> ceremony. I was in a pretty intimidating <a href=\n\"http://www.gg.ca/media/doc.asp?lang=e&amp;DocID=5205\">list of\nfolks</a>. I even got a long talk with <a href=\n\"http://www.conniekaldor.com/\">Connie Kaldor</a> (and I scored an\nautograph!).</p>\n\n",
