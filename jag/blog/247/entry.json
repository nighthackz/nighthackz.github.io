It\ngoes on my list of books that everyone should read. It paints a\ndisturbing picture of the modern industrial food system, that is\nnow up there with global warming on my list of things to worry\nabout. But the book is hopeful too. The system can be fixed, and\nthe movement to fix it is growing. One of the advantages of living\nnear San Francisco is that this is an area where a lot of folks\nconcerned about this problem are active. There are a lot of\nparadoxes to sort out: the human population of the planet has\nbecome immense, and it's not clear that sustainable healthy\ntechniques can feed us all.\n",
