<div class=entry><h1>Steve Jobs on Hewlett Packard</h1>
The bits and pieces of Steve Jobs's upcoming biography that have
been coming out have been fascinating. One particular one that
really rips me up is his <a href=
"http://news.cnet.com/8301-13924_3-20123830-64/steve-jobs-leaves-apt-rebuke-of-hewlett-packard/">rebuke
of the board of directors of Hewlett Packard, and in particular,
their leadership choices</a>. I absolutely agree with Jobs. It's
hard to describe the board's CEO choices as anything but completely
insane. They've gone from one really awful choice to another.
Hiring a CEO is a tricky thing, it often goes awry under the best
of circumstances. But they seem to be acting so stupidly that they
must be actively trying to tank the company. My wife worked for HP
under Mark Hurd in the headquarters complex: the place got totally
ground up. Apotheker did not understand any of HP's strengths and
tried to turn it into something he was familiar with: a weak shadow
of Oracle and IBM, which it had almost no basis to build from. What
will Meg Whitman do? Try to turn it into an auction house? The
board should fire themselves and put in place someone who knows how
to build and run a systems company. There aren't many around, but
they exist. The board needs to think in terms of investing in
building HP up to being a strong and vibrant company. Not stripping
it down into something that can be milked of its last pennies. 

<p>Who would I pick? I'm not completely sure, but the top of my
list is not too surprising: Scott McNealy. Wall Street and the
analysts hate him, having unfairly pilloried him for years. I've
got my own set of issues with him, but he could drive HP to being
incredible again. It's a world he understands better that anyone
else on the planet. HP used to be Sun's opponent, but I doubt that
this would be a problem for Scott: he's hugely into team sports and
knows that whatever the color of the shirt you wear during the
game, you play to win.</p>
