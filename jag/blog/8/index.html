One of the general principles that is commonly followed is avoiding
premature optimization. In general, I agree with this, although I
find it personally difficult: I learned to progam on a machine with
only 4K of RAM. These days, with RAM at $200/Gigabyte and multi-GHz
machines, we have the luxury of giving priority to issues like
cleanliness, modularity and development time. On the whole, this is
wonderful. But all too often I see this taken to an unhealthy
extreme and slow bloated software results.

<p>In the "no premature optimization" model of the world, you
ignore performance and build your system as cleanly as possible.
Then you measure and tune. But after the tuning is done you can
still find that the system is slow, but there's no real performance
problem that you can localize. It's just a generalized, diffused
slowness. A lot of small things spread everywhere that add up. One
of the common categories is things that lead to a lot of wasted
memory traffic. For example, if you're doing a lot of text
generation it's often easy to write code that uses string
concatenation a lot. I've seen code that uses <tt>String+</tt>char=
all over the place. This does a huge amount of copying and is much
less efficient than using StringBuffer. If you're doing heavy text
generation, consider designing APIs that append to StringBuffer
parameters, rather than returning Strings.</p>

<p>Another thorny area is data structure design. Whenever possible,
systems should be designed so that as much as possible of the data
structures is encapsulated. A great example of this is the
container classes. There are many different kinds of containers
with different performance characteristics but which all implement
the Map interface. If your application uses the Map interface to
declare all containers, then the constructor invocations can be
changed the accomodate different performance demands.</p>

<p>But this breaks down in applications where there is some data
structure that pervades everything. For example, if you were
building an editor for 3D models, almost all parts of the
application interact with the model data structure. You can do a
lot to hide the details, but there's only so much you can hide. If
you don't think hard about the data structure right at the
beginning of building the application, you're likely to end up with
big problems. In this situation, a "clean" design might involve
representing points as objects, and meshes as arrays of points. But
when the meshes get very large, this breaks down. A better
performing representation would be one or more arrays of floating
point values and <i>no</i> explicit point object.</p>

<p>It's all a matter of balance and forethought.</p>
