It's also mysterious enough that you can't really\ntell what's going on. These folks are having way too much fun.\nHere's a clip from an internal email from someone on the keynote\nsession production crew: \n\n<blockquote>\n  <i>Recently on an internal production call involving all\n  department heads, the Stage Manager, who is one of the best in\n  the country but who is new to J1, innocently asked, Why do you\n  have so much rehearsal time blocked out for just a t-shirt toss?\n  The entire call (all of whom experienced the trebuchet last year)\n  just burst out laughing. She sorta knows what we're in for, but\n  not really.</i> \n\n  <p><i>Please, please, please, make it easy this year...</i></p>\n</blockquote>Needless to say, we're not making it easy. :-)\n",
