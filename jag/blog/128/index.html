<img align=right src='2005_06_30_13-53-08-124_n13.small.jpeg'>My keynote was this morning, followed by a panel session and a blur
of conversations with the press, customers and developers. I could
write a book on what's gone on today, but I'm so tired after 4
incredible days that I'm not going to be able to do it all justice.


<p style="text-align: left">My keynote was essentially all toy
show. The first two demos were about developers tools, the third
was on sensor nets, and the fourth was the Boeing ScanEagle
experimental navigation system.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">The first tool demo was about the
combination of some new GUI layout stuff we've put out in a project
that we call <a href=
"http://www.netbeans.org/kb/articles/matisse.html" shape=
"rect">Matisse</a>, together with advanced components from Swing
Labs, to show how easy it is to create desktop applications in this
new world. The app we showed the creation of was a music
player.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">The second tool demo was s howing how
easy it has become to develope sophisticated apps for cellphones
using the <a href=
"http://www.netbeans.org/kb/articles/mobility.html" shape=
"rect">NetBeans mobility support</a>. My favorite part came at the
very end where we downloaded the app to a cellphone and did the
debugging live (including hitting breakpoints and examining
variables) on a real handset - not in an emulator.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">The third demo was some cool <a href=
"http://netbeams.org/" shape="rect">sensor net stuff</a> that
combined the work of folks at Agilent, SFSU and Sun to put very
powerful and flexible sensors into San Francisco Bay. They use cell
phones to communicate from the sensor to the network, JXTA to deal
with organization, and data publishing via RSS (yes: the sensors
are technically bloggers).</p>

<p style="text-align: left">The fourth demo was navigation software
for the Boeing <a href=
"http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/military/unmanned/scaneagle.html"
 shape="rect">ScanEagle</a> automous aircraft. It's a realtime java
application that essentially acts as the pilot of the aircraft, it
gets told what to observe with its camera, and it goes there and
flies an observation pattern. No human pilot onboard or on the
ground.</p>
