  "body" : "Lots and lots of cool stuff... Not nearly enough time to write\nabout it all. The thrills started even before the keynote: the jazz\ngroup that provided the opening music including one of my all time\nfavorite musicians: <a href=\n\"http://www.quillsquotesandnotes.com/wrpaulhorn.htm\" shape=\n\"rect\">Paul Horn</a>. A real treat. \n\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Then there was all the stuff about open\nsourcing of our app server, a project internally named GlassFish.\nIt's all out there at <a href=\"https://glassfish.dev.java.net/\"\nshape=\"rect\">glassfish.dev.java.net</a>. We've been pricing the\nbinaries at $0 for quite a while, now all of the source is out\nthere for anyone to grab and play with. It'll be the place where we\ndo our work on the evolution of Java EE.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left\"><a href=\"http://ibm.com/java\" shape=\n\"rect\">IBM</a> being there was wonderful: the contract negotiations\nhad gone on for quite a while, and resolved to everyone's\nsatisfaction.

Java (a relative of the J2ME spec) is how\ndynamic behavior is defined on a DVD disk: every DVD player will\nhave a Java VM and a network connection. There are huge\npossibilities...</p>\n\n<p>Then there was the new stuff in Java Studio Creator...\nParticularly the support for <a href=\n\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX\" shape=\"rect\">AJAX</a>.</p>\n\n",
