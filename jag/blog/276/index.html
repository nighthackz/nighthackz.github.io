<img align=right src='Sketchpad-Apple.jpg'>I spent the afternoon at the <a href=
"http://www.computerhistory.org/">Computer History Museum</a> at an
event celebrating the 70th birthday of <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Sutherland">Ivan Sutherland</a>.
He's famous for a whole lot of things, the earliest being <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketchpad">Sketchpad</a>, a
<i>man-machine graphical communication system</i> that he built in
1962. In a lot of computing fields, and particularly in graphics,
if you read any paper and follow the bibliography links back,
you're almost certain to find something written by Ivan or one of
his students. <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Sproull">Bob Sproull</a> MC'd the
event and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay">Alan
Kay</a> (one of Ivan's student's) gave a long talk. The list of
people that showed up to honor Ivan was amazing. A couple who's
names you might know were Henri Gouraud and John Warnock. 

<p>When I was working on my PhD thesis, I noticed that all the
papers I was reading had backpointers eventually to Sketchpad. When
I finally read Ivan's thesis, I was totally blown away. I ended up
with Ivan on my thesis committee and I think of my thesis as a
macro-expansion of about half a page from Sketchpad.</p>

<p>You really should <a href=
"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-574.pdf">read his
thesis</a>. It will blow you away. Among many other things, it can
be fairly said that Ivan invented Object Oriented Programming.</p>

<p>For another life-altering experience, you should read one of his
few non-technical papers, <a href=
"http://research.sun.com/techrep/Perspectives/smli_ps-1.pdf">Technology
and Courage</a>. Besides being an outstanding researcher, he's also
started a couple of companies and is a venture capitalist: his
advice on courage is mandatory reading.</p>
