Between their fascinating simulation of\nmuscle dynamics for accurate skin deformations, the many ways they\nused deep alpha maps &amp; abused the immense size of their disk\nfarm, to the studly tricks they did with <a href=\n\"http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/envmap/\">spherical\nharmonics</a> to fake out global illumination, I'm impressed. Huge\nfun.\n",
