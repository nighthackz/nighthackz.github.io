<div class=entry><h1>SOA: Buzzworld Whiplash or Real Meat?</h1>
For some odd reason, long lost in the fuzzy recesses of my memory,
I agreed to give a talk last week at Oracle OpenWorld on SOA. It's
a topic that I'm not an expert on. There are lots of people around
who know far more about it than I do. A lot of my unease about
giving the talk was that I was very confused about what SOA is, and
that ended up being what I spent most of my hour onstage talking
about. 

<p style="text-align: left">There are a lot of corporations,
analysts, consultants, experts, "experts" and pundits saying a lot
of things about SOA, without a lot of consistancy about the meaning
of the term. When you expand the acronym to "Service Oriented
Architecture" you get a pretty good, but broad, picture. The <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture"
shape="rect">Wikipedia definition</a> is one of the better ones out
there. In most descriptions, SOA has become a broad cellectiom of
techniques that go far beyond just architecting systems as
services. The topic feels a lot like that quote from <a href=
"http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Lewis_Carroll" shape="rect">Through
the Looking Glass</a>:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5i; text-align: left"><i>'When I use a
word,' Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful tone, 'it means just
what I choose it to mean--neither more nor less.'<br clear="none">
'The question is,' said Alice, 'whether you CAN make words mean so
many different things.'<br clear="none">
'The question is,' said Humpty Dumpty, 'which is to be master...
that's all.'</i></p>

<p style="text-align: left">There is a collection articles that
insist that SOA is not OOP (or OOP-ITL [Object Oriented Programming
In The Large]). They draw weird distinctions that mostly
demonstrate how little they understand of OOP. A common
misunderstanding is the belief that everything that can be done to
an object must be a method on the object - for example that "play"
must be a method on a "MusicCD" object, tying the service to the
object. In this example, the right way to have done it is to
represent the CD player as an object distinct from the CD itself,
which would be played with a statement like "player.play(cd)". OOP
is a modeling tool, how you choose to model a situation is a matter
of taste, the situation at hand, and engineering judgement.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">Then there's the camp that defines SOA
as just being the same as OOP. I rather like this because it meshes
well with the phrase "Service Oriented Architecture", which is the
way that I tend to think of most good OOP designs. Using the
previous example, rather than having verbs like "play" be methods
on the CD object it's usually better to try to restrict methods to
things that are intrinsic to the object. One could argue in this
world that perhaps SOA could be thought of as a subset of OOP,
since there are many other architectures that can be modeled within
OOP.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">One of the concepts here that is often
not made clear in these discussions is the distinction between a
<b>serv<u>er</u></b> and a <b>serv<u>ice</u></b>. A server is an
implementation artifact: usually a machine. A service is an
abstract concept that may be implemented by some number of servers
(perhaps zero, perhaps many). The mapping between services and
servers should be dynamic, depending on factors like load and
quality of service - implemeted in things like the N1 Service
Provisioning System.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">The last bit of confusion for me is
that in most discussions, SOA is about more than just architecting
around services. The "S" in SOA should expand to "Scale", since so
much of what is talked about is how to archtect these systems for
large scales. <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stateless_server" shape=
"rect">Statelessness</a> and <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotent_%28software%29" shape=
"rect">idempotence</a> are techniques that have been around for
years (both appear, for example, in the design of NFS from 20 years
ago) are usually considered key components of SOA
architectures.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">In the end, there's a big bag of
techniques that you may or may not want to use. Whether the
collection you need fits someone's definition of SOA shouldn't
matter - do what's appropriate. Statelessness and idempotence are
tough and only really valuable at high levels of scale. Proper OO
structuring is always a good idea.</p>
