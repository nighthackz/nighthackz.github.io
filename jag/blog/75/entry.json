This has become pretty popular as a meta-principle,\nshowing up in places like <a href=\n\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?SevenHabitsOfHighlyEffectivePeople\" shape=\n\"rect\">The Seven Habits Of Highly Effective People</a> and <a href=\n\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExtremeProgrammingApplied\" shape=\n\"rect\">Extreme Programming</a> where it shows up as <a href=\n\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?SharpenTheSaw\" shape=\"rect\">Sharpen the\nSaw</a>.\n\n<p>In general, it's a great priniciple. Folks like me who have made\ntool-making a big part of their life lean on it all the time.\nSometimes, too much. There are a couple of dark sides: the one that\npeople talk about most is that it's important to actually finish\nsharpening the axe and get back to chopping. Often tool building is\nfar more fun than actually doing the job at hand.</p>\n\n<p>But for me, the big problem with \"axe sharpening\" is that it's\nrecursive, in a <a href=\n\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/alabaster/A524242\" shape=\n\"rect\">Xeno's paradox</a> kinda way: You spend the first two thirds\nof the time alloted to accomplishing a task actually working on the\ntool. But working on the tool is itself a task that involves tools:\nto sharpen the axe, you need a sharpening stone. So you spend\ntwo-thirds of the sharpening time coming up with a good sharpening\nstone. But before you can do that you need to spend time finding\nthe right stone. And before you can do that you need to go to the\nnorth coast of Baffin Island where you've heard the best stones for\nsharpening come from. But to get there, you need to build a dog\nsled....</p>\n\n<p>Xeno's paradox is resolved because while it is an infinite sum,\nit's an infinite sum of exponentially decaying values. No such luck\nin this case. The tool building jobs just get bigger, and you\npretty quickly can lose sight of what it was you started to do.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, I don't have a clue what I'm doing, but I'm\nhaving fun on the road to getting whatever it was done.</p>\n\n",
