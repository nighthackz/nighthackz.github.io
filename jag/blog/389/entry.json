We'll inspect\nthem in the water and clean off any debris or hitch-hiking\ncreatures, then we'll send them on their way. You'll notice on the\npicture that there are only 3 gliders. The fourth didn't get\ndestroyed, it's still on it's way. Something has gone wrong with\nthe Iridium satellite link - we can contact it by other means.\nWe're not totally sure what happened, but it looks like the Iridium\nmodem's software got accidentally (?) upgraded over-the-air (not by\nus). We're very curious to see what actually happened.\n",
