<img align=right src='Image97-large.jpeg'>A bunch of people have been downloading <a href=
"http://huckster.dev.java.net" shape="rect">Huckster</a> and
joining the community. The question I keep getting is "why hasn't
anything new been checked in recently". It's a combination of
factors: one is that (sadly) I have a day job. The big one is that
I got this goofy idea: could I do something cool by integrating 3D
(JOGL+Xith) into Huckster? The answer was <i>yes</i>, but there was
a problem: I needed to go between the 3D world, and 2D. I wanted to
render 2D into texture maps, and then get them to fly around on the
screen. This actually works fine on my OSX machine. With one big
problem: performance. OpenGL/JOGL/Xith are quite particular about
how their pixels are laid out. Java2D has these great ColorModel
objects that allow it to handle any pixel layout you might want to
use, so it's possible to specify the OpenGL preferred pixel layout
-- but only a few of them are optimized, and the one OpenGL likes
doesn't have an optimized rendering pipeline. I've tried lots of
combinations: mostly variations on either rendering directly to
texture maps or rendering to a {Volatile,Buffered}Image then
<tt>drawImage</tt>ing it into a texture map. I still havn't found
one with performance that makes me happy. I did do an experiment
with Java3D and got much better performance for 2D-&gt;3D, but I'd
like to stick with JOGL. So now I'm off, in my copious spare time,
trying to figure out how to accelerate JOGL imaging. 

<p>One of the annoying side problems is that OpenGL requires that
texture maps have power-of-two sizes, which forces me into all
sorts of contortions, since slides and slide fragments don't fit
well into power-of-two sizes. I was really happy when the <a href=
"http://www.opengl.org/documentation/opengl_current_version.html"
shape="rect">OpenGL 2.0</a> spec got rid of this restriction. I can
hardly wait for this to percolate out into deployed OpenGL
implementations.</p>
