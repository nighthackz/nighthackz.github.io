My younger daughter and I stayed up for\na couple of hours to watch the event in its full glory. The\nespecially cool part was watching the moon turn a beautiful red\n(sunset red, literally) when it was total. I had a hell of a time\n(ultimatly failing) trying to get the totality picture in proper\nfocus.\n",
