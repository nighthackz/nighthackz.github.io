  "body" : "I'm spending the week in Iceland, wandering the country with my\nsister, assorted cousins, and some folks from <a href=\n\"http://www.skyrr.is/\">Skyrr</a>. The countryside is spectacular.\nIt is totally unlike anything I've ever seen anywhere else. Totally\nvolcanic, the rules of geology here are just different. Weird\nstructures. Moonscapes. Phenomenal waterfalls. Unexpected lushness.\nLovely! \n\n<p>And don't forget your <a href=\n\"http://www.cafepress.com/OrcOmit\">JavaOne/OpenWorld</a> t-shirt!\nSince Ellison is <a href=\n\"http://www.smh.com.au/technology/enterprise/hp-sues-scandalplagued-former-ceo-mark-hurd-over-oracle-job-20100908-1508n.html\">showing\nhis colors</a>, show him yours!</p>\n\n",
