  "body" : "I'm in DC for the Stewart/Colbert rally tomorrow. I bought one of\nColbert's \"I have a scream\" t-shirts online and decided to wear it\ntoday, the day before the rally. I kept being stopped in the\nstreets by people who asked where they could buy one of the shirts.\nMy answer of \"online\" was disappointing, but it always led to an\ninteresting conversation. In the last few hours I've met dozens and\ndozens of friendly people who've traveled to DC from all over. I\ncan't wait until tomorrow. It's an amazing time. \n\n<p>PS. Someone missed a great opportunity to sell a lot of t-shirts\nin the streets today :-)</p>\n\n<p>PPS. For those folks wondering why I'm willing to go to this\nevent in DC when I cancelled the events I was supposed to be at in\nEurope. The answer is simple: my recent jaw surgery stops me from\ntalking too much, but it doesn't interfere with walking.</p>\n\n",
