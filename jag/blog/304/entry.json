  "body" : "JavaOne is finally beginning! Getting ready for this one has been\nan incredible amount of work for everyone involved. The lineup of\nsessions is superb. I had a *really* hard time picking the Duke's\nchoice winners (they all deserved to win). The engineering teams\nhave been doing grand acts of heroism to get a pile of software\nreleases ready. The demos have come together beautifully. Some are\na little too close to the bleeding edge, but that's what makes them\nfun. The big surprise for everyone is attendance: given what we had\nbeen hearing about attendance at other conferences, we braced for\nthe worst.... But we've done rather nicely. I'm *so* looking\nforward to the Toy Show on Friday. There's some jaw-dropping stuff\nto see.\n",
