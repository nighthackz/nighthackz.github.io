  "body" : "For this years JavaOne T-Shirt Hurling Contest, the three finalist\nteams are led by Rob Butler, Roberto Diaz and Bruno Souza. Judging\nwas remarkably hard this time around because there were so many\ngood ones. Some were pretty edgy. Some, a little too edgy... I\nreally wanted the entry from La Jolla High School to be a finalist,\nbut they were a little to far on the other side of the \"don't freak\nout the fire marshal\" line: I would have loved to see their mixture\nof sodium pellets, O<sub>2</sub> and a toilet. \n\n<p>Thanks everyone! I'm looking forward to the fun at JavaOne! It'l\nbe hard for the first two teams to match the Brazilians craziness,\nbut I'm sure they'll do a good job of fighting back with some\noutrageous engineering.</p>\n\n",
