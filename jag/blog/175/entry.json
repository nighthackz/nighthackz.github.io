  "body" : "On average, I love my MacBook Pro. But the 85 watt power supply\nsucks... If only because a whole lot of airline in-seat power\nsupplies cut off at 75 watts. I've tried fussing with all kinds of\nsettings to get the power drain lowered. Even removing the battery\nwon't get it below the magic 75. Google hasn't helped either. If\nanyone knows any clever tricks to get a MacBooks power drain down,\nI'd love to hear about them.\n",
