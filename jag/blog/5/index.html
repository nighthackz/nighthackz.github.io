<div class=entry><h1>Flying at Mach 1</h1>
<i>I got dragged into a little flame-fest on a mailing list and got
a little out of hand... Here's a email from me:</i> 
<hr>

<p>What a troll-ish set of remarks based on zero knowledge and
spreading massive falsehoods. Normally I don't respond to such
drivel, but this time, if feels like I have to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <tt>From: XXX Subject: Re: YYY</tt> 

  <p><tt>No, as I understand it he is a C developer.</tt></p>
</blockquote>It is true, I have been a C developer, and I still do
occasionally. But I have also developed code in C++, Fortran,
Algol, SNOBOL, Mesa, Smalltalk, Pascal, Modula, Simula, Cobol,
Basic, Focal, BLISS, PL/1, Pearl, several versions of Lisp, and
assembler code for x86, Sparc, PowerPC, IBM 360/370, CDC 7000(CPU
and PPU), PDP {8,10,11,VAX} and a bunch of stuff too obscure for me
to remember at all. Of that lot I've probably written the most in C
- at least 500K lines of C written by me, personally, over a couple
of decades. For the last decade I've written almost zero C code and
write almost exclusively in Java. 

<blockquote>
  <tt>Apart from throwing T-shirts, he hasn't done any work with
  Java lately.</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>One could start a Clintonian debate on the use of the word
"with". Almost everything I write is in Java these days. I mostly
work on things other than the compiler or the JDK release.</p>

<p>This is the piece that makes my blood boil:</p>

<blockquote>
  <tt>He designed Java so marginally capable developers could have
  a job. Hence all the annoying little limitations that slow down
  development but prevent errors (and features). He finds it too
  limiting to use himself. I can't really blame him.</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>This is so damned false I don't know where to begin. I designed
Java so I could write more code in less time and have it be way
more reliable. In the past I've wasted huge numbers of hours
chasing down memory smashes and all the other time wasters that are
so typical of what happens when writing C code. I wanted to spend
time writing code, not debugging. Life is too short for debugging.
All of those little "limitations" turn out to be things that make
coding faster and debugging vanish.</p>

<p>For example, lots of newbie's coming in from the C world
complain about exceptions and the fact that they have to put
exception handling all over the place - they want to just write
their code. But that's stupid: most C code never checks return
codes and so it tends to be very fragile. If you want to build
something really robust, you need to pay attention to things that
can go wrong and most folks don't in the C world because it's just
to damn hard.</p>

<p>One of the design principles behind Java is that I don't care
much about how long it takes to slap together something that kinda
works. The real measure is how long it takes to write something
solid. Lots have studies have been done on developer productivity,
and Java beats C and C++ by a factor of 2.</p>

<p>It's kinda like the evolution of the airplane. Once upon a time
when folks scooted around in open cockpit biplanes they navigated
by sticking their heads out over the side of the plane and looking
down. When covered cockpits with windows were first introduced
pilots didn't like them because there was no way to stick their
head out. But if they had won the argument, they'd never have been
able to fly at Mach 1 or at 30,000 feet. Stick your head into a
Mach 1 airflow and see what the bloody stump looks like. I want to
fly at Mach 1. I'll take the windows.</p>

<p>I use the MAC because it's a great platform. One of the nice
things about developing in Java on the Mac is that you get to
develop on a lovely machine, but you don't cut yourself off from
deploying on other platforms. It's a fast and easy platform to
develop on. Rock solid. I never reboot my machine... Really!
Opening and closing the lid on a Powerbook actually works. The
machine is up and running instantly when you open it up. No
viruses. Great UI. All the Java tools work here: NetBeans and JEdit
are the ones I use most. I tend to think of OSX and Linux with QA
and Taste.</p>
