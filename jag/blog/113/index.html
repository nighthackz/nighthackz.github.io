<td valign=top class=content><div class=entry><h1>JavaExpo Madrid</h1>
<img align=right src='Image120-small.jpeg'>I'm in Madrid for a couple of days to participate in their
JavaExpo. I spent a couple of hours yesterday with a bunch of
customer service engineers who where telling me about what's
happening here in Spain. There has generally been an awful lot of
everything, but it was real clear that the big thing that stood out
for them was that this has been the year of enterprise applications
on cell phones. Spain has more than 100% market penetration (i.e.
more cell phones than people), of which the vast majority (&gt;80%)
are Java phones. 

<p>A lot of the cool applications have been enabled by the new
generation of MIDP2 phones that have network access. One app that's
become pretty popular amongst professional stock brokers is one
that allows them to watch stocks and place trades from their phones
- very popular over the lunch hour(s) :-)</p>

<p>There's a whole class applications that are for workforce
communication, essentially taking the place of walkie-talkies. Cell
phones work better than walkie-talkies in these applications
because they're point-to-point, longer range, have better noise
immunity, and they are app platforms; and they have better range
and are much cheaper than WiFi PDAs. One that they discribed to me
was a simple to-do list manager whose entries were things like "go
to gate X to help unload plane Y at Z o'clock". It's dynamically
and instantly updatable (they get updates to the phone in seconds).
Another kind of entry is a broadcast like "Would someone near X do
Y" which pops up a button that says "I'll do it" that when pressed
cancels the request on all other phones and pops up a button that
says "Done". Real simple, but if you're running something like an
airport: it's real powerful.</p>

<p>A note about my previous post: a few people wrote in to say
"huh?" about the title "1+1=<i>i</i>". I guess my lame attempt at
geek humour was too obscure: I was commenting on people's ability
(when reading stuff in the press) to add things up and get not just
the wrong answer, but a wrong answer that isn't even on the number
line.</p>
