But I couldn't help thinking about Phil Rosenzweig, who was\non AA 11. He was a great guy and a valued coworker. He worked at\nSun on the east coast, so I didn't get to see him much, but we\ntraded a fair amount of email. He was a major force behind the <a\nhref=\n\"http://labs.oracle.com/features/tenyears/volcd/papers/rosnzwg.htm\">Java\nReliable Multicast</a> API - that work took a huge hit when his\nplane hit the world trade center. He is missed. \n\n<p>We built a little memorial to him at the Sun campus in Menlo\nPark. It's now the new Facebook campus. So, folks at Facebook: take\ncare of it and think of Phil as you pass by.<br>\n</p>\n\n",
