The happy\npart for me is that despite having been on the witness list and\ngone through a bunch of prep work with lawyers, I didn't actually\nhave to testify. Despite all the furor that went into this one, it\nwent out with a wimper. Court cases are never about right and\nwrong, they're about the law and what you can convince a jury of.\nFor those of us at Sun who felt trampled-on and abused by Google's\ncallous self-righteousness, I would have preferred a different\noutcome - not from the court case as much as from events of years\npast.\n",
