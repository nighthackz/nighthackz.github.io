<div class=entry><h1>Engineering tradeoffs</h1>
I've been going to the <a href="http://airrace.org">Reno Air
Races</a> for quite a few years. While I'm not a pilot, I get quite
a kick out of the extreme engineering that the competitors engage
in. This year, there was an exciting twist: a new entrant that made
a very surprising tradeoff. At the right is a picture I took of a
stock P51 mustang during a race. These are planes that one would
normally think of as museum pieces, but they get rolled out and
flown at speed. There's something of a dichotomy in the group of
people that own these old planes: there's the crowd that goes for
authenticity, and there's the crowd that says "to hell with
authenticity, I want to go fast". This plane is pretty authentic.
One of the most visible features of the P51 is the lump hanging
down underneath the belly: this is the radiator and the airscoop
for it. As in so many areas of engineering, one of the biggest
problems in racing airplanes is dealing with heat. The normal
cooling system is meant to cope with a stock Rolls-Royce Merlin
engine that generates around 2000HP. 

<p>It isn't just mustangs that are raced. All kinds of planes
compete. One of the more exciting types of plane are the <a href=
"resource/AirshowLarge6.jpg" rel="lightbox" title=
"Grumman F7F Tigercat">Grumman F7F Tigercats</a> that have two huge
engines. At speed, these beasts make quite a thunder.</p>

<p><br clear="both">
 This airplane is <a href="http://www.strega.com/">Strega</a>, a
very highly modified P51 that has won many times (for a cooler
paint job, take a look at <a href="resource/AirshowLarge3.jpg" rel=
"lightbox" title="">VooDoo</a>). These are very highly modified
planes with chopped wings and somewhere in the neighborhood of 4000
hp coming from their hot-rodded engines. The cooling system is
highly modified too. One of the most interesting modifications that
is often done is to reshape the interior of the radiator chamber.
Theses engines generate a <i>lot</i> of heat. This gets dumped out
through the radiator, which causes the air passing through it to
heat up and expand. The chamber is often reshaped to act like the
bell in a rocket engine: Yes, they generate thrust from the waste
heat. Pretty clever.</p>

<p><br clear="both">
 This year a surprise entrant showed up named <a href=
"http://www.leewardairranch.com/racing">Galloping Ghost</a>. It was
a newly modified plane that had sat alone in a hanger somewhere for
many years. They really went to town modifying this plane. Chopped
wings, seriously hot-rodded engine, and a shockingly cool piece of
lateral thinking in the modification to the cooling system. If you
look at the photo, you'll see that they sawed off the radiator.
This is aesthetic sacrilege and (one would think) engineering
suicide. What happens to the phenomenal amount of heat that the
engine generates? Traditionally a cooling system is a closed loop
with heat generated in the engine and transported by a fluid
running through it to the radiator, where the heat is dumped and
the fluid recirculates. In this beast, they left out the radiator
and they just vent the fluid (mostly water). They've got a small
tank of water that's big enough to let the plane fly the race
before the water runs out. In this plane, water is a consumable,
just like fuel. It's a steam-powered airplane. There's one
interesting subtlety: in a normal heat exchanger, it's important
that the fluid not boil. This would create a lot of pressure and
probably blow a hole in something. So the fluid is usually
something more interesting than water. But in galloping ghost,
since the cooling system isn't a closed loop, they can let the
water boil. If you remember your physics lessons, the heat required
to do the liquid-to-gas phase change is immense. This means that
the cooling system uses less water than you'd expect.</p>

<p>Galloping Ghost was doing surprisingly well in the preliminary
races. Everyone was keyed up for the final race where all the top
contenders would race together and drive their planes to the limit.
This freakishly weird piece of upstart engineering had a shot. But
no, at the last moment the final race was cancelled because the
winds got too high and it was pretty clear that they weren't going
to die down. In the second-to-last race, which was also affected by
high winds, one of the planes had to declare a mayday and land
without an engine. But when it tried to land, the wind caused it to
roll and the plane was <a href=
"http://www.examiner.com/lake-tahoe-travel-in-reno/safety-first-reno-air-races-photos-picture">totalled
(read the article, the picture is cool)</a>. So the folks running
the race exercised some caution :-) Oh well, next year....</p>

<p><br clear="both">
 It isn't all about racing. They have the usual air show stuff.
Lots of performers doing tricks with airplanes. This year the <a
href="http://www.snowbirds.dnd.ca/">Snowbirds</a> came.</p>

<p>I'm all psyched for next year. I'm having fun on my time off. As
I type this I'm at the <a href=
"http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2010/">JAOO</a> conference in Aarhus
(It's been renamed "GOTO" for next year). More geek fun with a good
crowd of interesting smart people.</p>
