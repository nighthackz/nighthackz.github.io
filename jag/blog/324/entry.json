I really hated not\nbeing there. As to why I left, it's difficult to answer: Just about\nanything I could say that would be accurate and honest would do\nmore harm than good. The hardest part is no longer being with all\nthe great people I've had the privilege to work with over the\nyears. I don't know what I'm going to do next, other than take some\ntime off before I start job hunting. \n\n<p>This is the new home of my blog. It contains all of my old blog\nentries from Sun: Sun's blogging policy gave bloggers rights to\ntheir own works. The few more recent blog entries that I did at\nblogs.sun.com were written under somewhat more strict policies\n:-)</p>\n\n",
