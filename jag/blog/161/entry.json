  "body" : "I've received a fair number of questions about details of the\ncontest:\n\n<ul>\n  <li><i>How much time do we get to launch the shirts?</i> About 5\n  minutes</li>\n\n  <li><i>Are the shirts rolled or folded any special way?</i> No.\n  They're just regular t-shirts. You can fold, roll or package them\n  any way you'd like. Just make sure they're non-lethal (no\n  embedding in cannonballs, for example).</li>\n\n  <li><i>Is there a source of electricity?</i> Absolutely. There's\n  an internet connection too.</li>\n\n  <li><i>How many shirts do we need to launch?</i> As many as you\n  can in the time available. But don't worry about volume: previous\n  entrants have won even though they only managed to launch a\n  couple of shirts.</li>\n\n  <li><i>How far do the shirts have to be thrown?</i> It's several\n  hundred feet to the back of the room, but don't worry about\n  trying to go that far. 50 or 60 feet would be OK (but more is\n  better!).</li>\n\n  <li><i>How stable is the stage?</i> Launching doesn't happen from\n  the stage: it's too fragile. Usually it happens from a specially\n  built platform (roughly 20'x20') that gets rolled out next to the\n  stage. It's pretty robust. Suitable for mounting cannons and\n  siege weapons.</li>\n</ul>Don't be bashful! Keep those entries coming! Make Newton\nproud!\n",
