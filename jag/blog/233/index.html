...since my last blog entry. 2 months! What have I been doing?
Well... Mostly not stuff that's really blogable. I took a long
vacation because my wife started a new job, and she wanted to go
have some fun before starting. At work, life has been a good form
of madness: working on the JavaFX plan, helping to make sure that
all the pieces fit together and that everyone is building the right
thing. The tragedy of my life these days is that it doesn't really
work for me to do any coding for a real piece of the system: I'm
always getting dragged into some diversion or other, which messes
up my ability to deliver code. So I write irrelevant stuff on the
side, mostly doing little coding experiments. 

<p>This week is <i>fun</i>. I'm at <a href=
"http://www.siggraph.org/s2007/">Siggraph</a>. It's the one
conference I year that I go to to listen and learn (I've been
attending pretty regularly for about 25 years - what a horrible
thought!). I don't know what it is, but this is turning out to be
one of the best Siggraph's in years. Glenn Entis, the CTO of
Electronic Arts, did the keynote. My favorite line from it was
roughly "The Tool is the Game": lots of games these days (like The
Sims) have two major modes: gameplay and a
senario/space/prop/avatar/... design tool. They've been finding
that folks spend very large amounts of time in the tool - outside
of the game. Players get a huge amount of pleasure out of building
the world. Gameplay is sometimes almost at afterthought. Creativity
is fun!</p>

<p>One of my favorite parts of Siggraph is the Emerging
Technologies area. It's filled with stuff that is usually research
prototypes. Some of them are pretty far along. One kind of
technology that has shown up over and over again through the years
is electronic paper. It's generally "cool idea, lots of work to
do". But this year, the folks from <a href=
"http://www.eink.com/">e.ink</a> showed the most advanced stuff
I've ever seen. They're getting really close. The screens are
becoming gorgeous. Beautifully readable text in bright
sunlight.</p>

<p>As for papers, my favorite yesterday was the whole session on
non-photorealistic rendering. Every paper was interesting. Geeks
and artists in the same room. Wonderful!</p>
