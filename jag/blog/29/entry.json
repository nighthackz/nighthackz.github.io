  "body" : "My last blog entry stirred up a lot of commentary and flamage (and\nsome of the flamage was entertainingly wild: I love the Internet!).\nReading through it, it's clear that there's still confusion about\nthe meaning of our \"collaboration\" agreement with Microsoft.\n\n<p>While it is true that as a part of it we did sign up for\nMicrosoft's <i>Communications Protocol Program</i> that is a part\nof the US v. Microsoft case, our full agreement both modifies and\nexpands on it to give us a much more broad and useful agreement. It\nis important to understand that in no way does this lock Sun or Sun\ncustomers into interoperating with any Microsoft system on\nMicrosoft's strict terms. Right now, most of our interoperability\nis achieved through reverse-engineering. We have the option,\nentirely at our discretion, to access Microsoft's specifications\nthrough the collaboration agreement. But before we do so, on a\ncase-by-case basis, we will do an analysis of the business case for\nthe entanglements that such access implies (principally\nconfidentiality and royalties). Right now, the vast majority of the\nsoftware that we (Sun) produce has free and open specifications and\nwe provide the implementations of a large and growing fraction of\nit as open source. We are not going to slow down our involvement in\nthe open source community. Right now we have launched no projects\nthat will access any Microsoft specifications under the agreement -\nwe simply have the option to, if we decide that the benefits\noutweigh the costs.</p>\n\n",
