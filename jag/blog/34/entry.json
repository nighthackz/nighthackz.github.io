  "body" : "I just got back from a road trip through the UK and India. I got to\nmeet up with lots of Java developers. Lots of interesting folks\ndoing lots of cool projects. The high point was at the end of one\ntalk in Hyderabad one of the conference crew brought a birthday\ncake on stage (it was my birthday) and they had 3000 people sing\nhappy birthday to me. Quite overwhelming. Thanks, everyone!\n\n<p>The peace movement is quite strong everywhere. I took this\nphotograph of a chalk drawing on a street in London. Folks aren't\nexactly anti-American: they're anti-war. Everyone was hugely\nexcited about Michael Moore's new movie. I'm a very liberal\nCanadian living in America: I got lots of questions.</p>\n\n",
