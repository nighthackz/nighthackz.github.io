The locals were apologizing that \"only\" 6000 developers were\nthere: the conference center is only big enough to accommodate 6000\nattendees, and it's the largest conference center in India. The\nplace is just jammed. There are about 800,000 professional Java\ndevelopers in India, and we just don't have room for them all.\nYesterday morning I did some tourist exploring and ran into a bunch\nof them at a local temple: took a pile of photos and had some nice\nconversations. The really hard problem for me with conferences like\nthis is that it would be lovely to shake hands and talk to\neveryone. But there aren't enough hours in a day. It's nice to have\na break from the incessant pessimism of the global economic\nmeltdown.\n",
