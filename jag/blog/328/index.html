<div class=entry><h1>I want to like the iPad</h1>
<div class="floatImage">
  Neither Fish nor Fowl
</div>Really, I do. I put in my order for a 3G iPad on day 1 and
calmly waited my turn for the Blessed Object to arrive. It has that
`I must have it' sensuality that Apple has become so good at. But a
week later, I don't get it. It's magical, but the magic feels more
<a href="resource/oz-curtains1.jpg" rel="lightbox" title=
"Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain!">Oz</a> than <a
href="resource/dumbledore_1.jpg" rel="lightbox" title=
"*this* is a wand!">Dumbledore</a>. It feels more like a business
model looking for a device to express it, rather than something
that actually fills a need. I like a lot of Apple products, but
this one is a clear victory of style over substance. 

<p>I've been trying to figure out what it's good for, where it
shines. Lounging around on the couch browsing the web is pretty
wonderful. But if I want to take it with me, it falls apart: it
doesn't just follow me, the way my iPhone does, which is attached
to me. I have to actually put it in my hand. It's exactly as easy
and as hard to bring with me as a laptop - it takes up a hand or a
slot in my backpack. It's a little lighter. But not by enough to
make a difference. And yet it's a whole lot less useful than a
laptop. It's difficult to do much typing with: the onscreen
keyboard is clumsy, and when I try to use it for long, my fingers
end up hurting because the hard glass doesn't smoothly cushion my
fingers the way a good keyboard does. I bought a bluetooth keyboard
to use with it, which works well, but then I'm lugging two objects
instead of one, and without a mouse I'm constantly having to lift
my hand off the keyboard to touch the screen, which then makes it
fall over :-(</p>

<p>I know I'm deeply <i>not</i> the target market, so my
disillusionment probably doesn't matter. But I've watched my
twelve-year-old daughter play with it. She likes it for playing
games, but oddly enough, she seems to prefer my iPhone because it's
a more comfortable size, and it's easier to take along. She browses
the web with it, but as soon as she starts typing complicated URLs
or Google queries, she heads over to the laptop.</p>

<p>And then there's the control-freak's-fantasy-developer-model.
Yikes.... <a href=

has been written by others about that nightmare.</a></p>

<p>My fantasy Apple product is simple: stop treating OS X like
abandon-ware.</p>
