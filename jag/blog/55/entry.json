  "body" : "This is me with a rather borg-esque Simon Ritter during rehearsals\nfor my keynote tomorrow. I'm doing all demos. No slides. Just weird\nstuff. One of the funny things that happened was that this\noverlapped with the \"After Dark\" party at the Warfield where we\nauctioned off the paintings that were done by four artists that we\ngot to produce works on the show floor. I was originally supposed\nto be the auctioneer, but the rehearsal kept stretching out... So\nLaura Ramsey called me during the auction. I was on stage, working\nthrough the keynote, with the stage director telling me were to\nstand and move about. At the same time I had my cell phone glued to\nmy ear and was calling out bids that Laura was relaying. Truly\nsurreal.\n",
