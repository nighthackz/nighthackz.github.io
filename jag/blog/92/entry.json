You've\nprobably seen him around: he's the one wearing the Brazilian flag\nas a cape. They did these great t-shits this year that are based on\na famous painting of the battle for Brazilian Independence. They\nphotoshoped Duke into the painting: on a horse, waving a sword...\n\n<p>He's also involved in the Brazilian Healthcare project and was\none of the folks who took me on the tour of the system. They're\ndoing a talk this week that should be very cool.</p>\n\n",
