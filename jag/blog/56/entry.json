  "body" : "After the rehearsal I was accosted in the lobby of the W by the\nartists who produced the works that were auctioned off. They\nsavagely forced me to drink beer with them. Across the room,\nsomeone passed out and one of the artists drew up a sign. Everyone\nwanted to be photographed with the person who passed out. I have no\nidea who the poor soul was, but he's now famously captured in a\nzillion photographs. The artists really wanted to paint a moustache\non him, but but in a show of uncommon restraint, they didn't\nbecause all of the tools they had would have left permanent marks.\nDon't pass out within range of an artist.\n",
