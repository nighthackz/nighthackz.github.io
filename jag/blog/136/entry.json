  "body" : "Having taken a chunk of time off in August to hang out with family\n(including one very active 90-year-old aunt's birthday party) I'm\nback at work. This week I've been visiting customers and\nparticipating in developer events. I spent Monday in Zurich\nvisiting developers. The rest of the week I've spent in St\nPetersburg (not Florida). We did a big developer event on Thursday\nand ended up with hugely more folks attending than we had expected.\nWe had people sitting in the aisles in the theatre. \n\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Besides having cornered the world\nmarket in over-the-top <a href=\n\"http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/index.html\" shape=\n\"rect\">palaces</a>, St Petersburg has a large population of\ntalented software developers. Sun has an engineering center here\nwhere we do a lot of work on JavaSE and JavaME and C/C++/Fortran(!)\noptimizing compilers.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Next week: <a href=\n\"http://www.javachina.cn/IndexE.jsp\" shape=\"rect\">JavaChina</a></p>\n\n",
