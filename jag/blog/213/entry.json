  "body" : "One of the best parts of my job is going on customer visits.\nYesterday I got to visit the folks that run HBO&amp;Cinemax. No,\nnot the CEO and a pile of executives: the folks who make the bits\nflow. The server and storage farms, the transcoding arrays, the\nvideo stream construction and the satellite uplinks. It's all in an\nimpressive 5 9's reliability site on Long Island. Redundant\neverything. Big power supplies. There are big bags of Java code in\nthe control system. I had a great time with the engineers who\ndesigned, built and run the whole thing. One of the pieces was the\napp that schedules and manages the movement and assembly of assets\n(movies, commercials, whatever...) from the storage arrays to the\nsatellite streamers. It's really the central crossbar that gets\neverything to the right place at the right time. The hard part is\ndoing that and dealing with all of the failure scenarios -\nincluding the failure of itself. \n\n<p>A few weeks ago I got to visit a bunch of engineers at <a href=\n\"http://www.sabre.com\">Sabre</a> - the folks behind travelocity and\na whole lot of the IT infrastructure of modern civil aviation. One\nof the fellows I talked to was involved in the piece of software\nthat decides where to put containers that are loaded into aircraft:\nbalancing the load so that the planes don't fall out of the sky.\nMission critical everything. They're a huge Java shop.</p>\n\n<p>And before that it was FedEx - more Java engineers than Sun...\nThe Weather Channel... Home Depot... Delta airlines... Equifax...\nCingular...</p>\n\n<p>There are so many ways that Java apps touch peoples lives every\nday. And they aren't even aware of it. The web is just the tip of\nthe iceberg.</p>\n\n",
