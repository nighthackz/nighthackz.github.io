  "body" : "One of the cooler things that was done this year was the timeline.\nThis was (is?) a set of panels along the wall in a hallway with\nyears marked on it. Initially, the panels were blank. There were\nfelt tip markers and invitations for people who pass by to write\nnotes about events that happened in the Java world. It has turned\ninto a lovely organic expression of all that has happened. We\nthought it would be a good idea, but it turned out more wonderful\nthan we expected. Truly an artifact of value. We haven't quite\nfigured out what to do with it. A coffee table book, perhaps? A\ndisplay at the Computer History Museum?\n",
