  "body" : "The netbeans folks are getting pretty far along in the release\ncycle for 6.9, and the FX folks got their 1.3 release out. Between\nthe two they've done a a nice bundle that I've been playing around\nwith for a while. There's a whole <a href=\n\"http://netbeans.org/community/releases/69/\">laundry list of\nimprovements</a>. The biggest thing you'll notice in NetBeans is\nOSGi support and a bunch of improvements in the \"platform\" support\n(using the core of NetBeans as the basis of your own applications).\nIt's getting pretty sweet. \n\n<p>On the FX side, the performance boosts are wonderful; as are all\nthe new UI components and the tooling in NetBeans to support\nit.</p>\n\n",
