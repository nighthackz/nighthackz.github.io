Killed some nasty\n  bugs. I added simple support for right-to-left languages like\n  Hebrew and Arabic. I'm at the limit of my ability to test it (I\n  don't know either Hebrew or Arabic, so my understanding of the\n  issues is weak). Any volunteers?</li>\n\n  <li>Congratulations to the NetBeans team! They got a <a href=\n  \"http://www.infoworld.com/slideshow/2007/01/25-2007_technology-3.html\">Technology\n  of the Year Award</a> from Infoworld.</li>\n\n  <li>I'm <i>so</i> in love with the <a href=\n  \"http://www.netbeans.org/products/profiler/\">profiler</a> in\n  NetBeans.</li>\n\n  <li>I've been having fun with a funky Java game: <a href=\n  \"http://www.banghowdy.com\">Bang!
