<div class=entry><h1>Compiler fun</h1>
There's lots of fun to be had playing around with javac. I've never
been real happy with debates about language features, I'd much
rather implement them and try them out. For example, over
christmas, <a href=
"http://weblogs.java.net/blog/forax/archive/2006/12/call_me_santa.html">R&#233;mi
Forax</a> did an implementation of the ":=" declaration syntax,
along with some other type inferencing touches. [I used to give
myself an annual christmas present: I'd do a "Christmas hack" that
was just for fun... That ended when children entered the picture.
My Christmas hack was fun, but children are better] 

<p>For years I've wanted to set up a "<a href=
"http://ksl.dev.java.net">Kitchen Sink Language</a>" website for
experimentation. A place where people could throw language
features, no matter how absurd, just so that folks could play
around. Now that javac has been open-sourced, it's easy. Peter von
der Ah&#233; beat me to it and built the site, but he hasn't quite
got it ready yet.</p>

<p>Playing with javac is particularly easy since it got repackaged
as a NetBeans extension. It's an odd but slick way to make it
easily available: when running NetBeans 5.5, go to the update
center. You'll find a javac project tool... Download it and create
a javac project. It gets pre-populated with all the sources of
javac. Lots of fun.</p>

<p>Even if you don't want to create a new language extension,
installing the javac sources is interesting if you like studying
compilers. It's a particularly nicely written one. No, I didn't
write it: I wrote the original java compiler, which was a C
program. It has thankfully been dead for years.</p>

<p>If you're into extreme sillyness, you can rewack the parser
completely so that it will compile other languages. Several years
ago I actually wrote a Fortran parser on top of javac - it was good
enough to compile LINPACK, but not much else. I did eventually come
to my senses and throw it away.</p>

<p>Another thing you can use javac for is dropping code into it
that studies the parse tree. I like to do that when analysing
language features: come up with a tree walker that looks for things
that could be rewritten to use a proposed new feature. Rather than
using javac, you can play with Jackpot in NetBeans to get the same
capabilities (Jackpot is really just a UI for the AST). It's pretty
depressing how few new language features improve more that a thin
sliver of code. One of the reasons I like ":=" and operator
overloading for [] to map to container classes is that they
simplify visual clutter all over the place.</p>
