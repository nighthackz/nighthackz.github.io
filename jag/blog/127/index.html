<img align=right src='2005_06_28_13-43-48-387_n5.small.jpeg'>Peter Moore and his mates from <a href="http://cenqua.com/" shape=
"rect">Cenqua</a> in Australia were the second contestants in the
T-Shirt contest. Their entry was a contraption (I don't know a
better word: Rube Goldberg would have been thrilled) that used
centrifugal force to propel the shirts, and a pile of electronics
to figure out when to let go. If you'd like to get a better look,
they have a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/pte/tags/tshc" shape=
"rect">large collection of photos</a> up on the web. The release
mechanism involved infrared sensors on the spinning wheel that
operated the solinoids that released the shirts. The sensors were
used to receive trigger information from the computer and a funky
wire-wrapped board. 

<p style="text-align: left">The early prototypes were pretty
straightforward. No electronics. Real reliable. What they ended up
with was a total victory for creeping featurism.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">They managed to launch a reasonable
number of shirts, and got great range, but the vast majority of the
shirts were randomly spewed all over the stage and backdrop. The
infrared sensors were their undoing, and an interesting case study
in just how hard testing is.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">They had done a lot of testing, in lots
of circumstances. They had had problems the night before with the
stage lights having enough IR to trigger the device prematurely.
They had tuned and corrected for that. But it was the large,
professional-grade photographic flashes that did it. No one had
fired off one of those in the vicinity of the launcher during any
test runs.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">Just as in every branch of engineering,
"shit happens", and it's incredibly hard to predict.</p>
