All kinds of geek toys, but in a\ndifferent space than most computer folks experience. This is a\ncrowd of people that hot-rod airplanes. The most popular category\nbeing WWII fighter planes like the P-51 Mustang and the Bearcat.\nThere are also folks having fun of another sort. This series of\nphotographs is of a Chinook helecopter dropping a car into the\ndesert. It's really a display of my newest toy: I bought my first\nCanon lens with image stabilization (the 100-400 zoom) and does it\never work. I shot these pictures with it at 400mm using my 10D,\nholding it by hand, swinging the lens to follow the chopper and the\nfalling car. Totally stable. Cool....\n\n<p><br clear=\"none\">\n<br clear=\"none\">\n<br clear=\"none\">\n<br clear=\"none\">\n</p>\n\n",
