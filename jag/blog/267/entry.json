This is a major milestone for us.\nWe've even debated renaming 6u10 to JDK 7 - but it has no API\nchanges and is totally focused on deployment and desktop\nintegration, including coping with the-Joy-that-is-Vista.\nCongratulations to everyone involved. I saw some demos of parts of\nit yesterday (mostly applet stuff), and it was real sweet. Take it\nout for a spin.\n",
