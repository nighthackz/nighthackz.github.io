  "body" : "Yes, Dale Yoakum and I really did build this crazy trebuchet. It's\na pile of 4x4s for the platform and side supports. The\ncounterweights are 100 lbs of exercise weights and the throwing arm\nis a hunk of 1.5\" square perforated steel tubing. Building it was a\nlot of fun.\n\n<p>The hard part was getting the trajectory right. To be efficient,\nthey really want to hurl things with a very high arc. But the hall\nthat the keynotes are in, Hall D, has a rather low ceiling. In past\nyears they keynotes have been in halls A/B/C which join together\ninto one gigantic hall with a very high ceiling and the exhibition\nhas been in hall D. But the exhibition has grown so much that they\nwanted to put it in A/B/C so the keynotes got punted to D.</p>\n\n<p>We had originally wanted to fire the trebuchet from the stage.\nBut in practicing last night we kept whacking the speakers, lights\nand trusses. Getting a flat arc was difficult to make predictable\nbecause the adjustments were very sensitive in that range. So we\nmoved it off to the side where we got an extra four feet by being\non the floor instead of the stage, and there was less clutter in\nthe ceiling. It was carefully aligned along a slot where there were\nno speakers or lights up near the ceiling.</p>\n\n<p>Yes. The contest is on. Don't send me suggestions for how to\nhurl t-shirts, that's what the contest is about! Over the next\nmonth or two I'll be putting together some contest rules - I'll\nprobably set up a Wiki Web to discuss ideas for how to structure\nthe contest. Later...</p>\n\n",
