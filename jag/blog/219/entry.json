One of the things I love to do is \"open mic\"\nquestion and answer sessions: I got some really good grillings on\nthis trip. I had promised myself that I would do a lot of blogging\nthis time, but it never happened. Between being booked for too many\nhours a day and an irrational need to sleep, I didn't succeed.</p>\n\n<p>One particularly interesting visit I went on was to the <a href=\n\"http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk\">Computing Laboratory at the University\nof Kent</a>. It (along with <a href=\n\"http://www.deakin.edu.au/\">Deakin University</a>) is the home of\n<a href=\"http://bluej.org\">BlueJ</a>. BlueJ is a great teaching\ntool/methodology/IDE that is used in schools an Universities all\nover the world. They've come up with a new thing called <a href=\n\"http://greenfoot.org/about/whatis.html\">greenfoot</a>, which is a\ncross betwen a framework/API for creating two-dimensional\ngames&amp;simulations and the BlueJ IDE. It's designed to help\nmotivate kids to learn programming by making it easy for them to\nwrite games. Even if you're not a kid, the framework is a lot of\nfun.</p>\n\n",
