<img align=right src='2005_10_04_20-54-21-852_n3.small.png'>Back when I was a grad student I was spinning out of control trying
to come up with a thesis topic. My <a href=
"http://www.computerhistory.org/events/index.php?spkid=2&amp;ssid=1090276799"
 shape="rect">advisor</a> took me out to lunch one day and asked me
a simple question: "What is a PhD thesis?" I yattered on for a
while and he listened patiently. Eventually he said "No: It's just
a stack of 100 pages with 4 signatures on top". I was falling into
a common grad student trap of feeling that I needed to do something
grandiose and solve all of the worlds problems. He was into "keep
it simple". So I did, and I came up with a pretty straightforward
thesis proposal. The odd thing was that when I finally finished my
thesis, I realized that I had only delt with one sentence out of
the simplified proposal. 

<p style="text-align: left">I got a lot of email about my previous
post, a lot of it centered on JINI, RMI and CORBA. Not too many
months ago, during the hypon flux storm [by analogy with <a href=
"http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/B/bogon-flux.html" shape=
"rect">bogon flux</a>] surrounding SOA and Web Services it was
worth one's life to mention that folks had been successfully
implementing SOAs for years. That has calmed down significantly. <a
href="http://www.jini.org/" shape="rect">JINI</a> is particularly
interesting since it goes significantly beyond what's possible with
today's SOA - but it only works in a Java-only universe. The folks
who developed RMI/JINI had previously worked on CORBA. A big chunk
of the complexity of CORBA comes from trying to solve the
cross-language problem. They discovered that if you don't try to
solve that problem, some very cool things emerge. The poster child
for building SOAs on JINI is <a href=
"http://www.jini.org/solutions/Jini_Orbitz_Profile_Final.pdf"
shape="rect">Orbitz</a>. There are some interesting discussions <a
href=
"http://www.jroller.com/page/csterwa?entry=jim_waldo_s_talk_on"
shape="rect">here</a> and <a href=
"http://www.jini.org/events/0505NYSIG/index.htm" shape=
"rect">here</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">In response to the comment about OO and
granularity: they really are orthogonal axes. OO methodologies work
well regardless of granularity. But granularity is related to the
question of whether or not an operation can sensibly involve a
network transit: it only works well when granularity is high. This
is a direct corollary of the <a href=

Fallicies of Distributed Computing</a>.</p>
