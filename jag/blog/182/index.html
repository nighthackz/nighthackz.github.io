<div class=entry><h1>JavaOne, day 1.75</h1>
I had intended to do a pile of blogging during day 1 of JavaOne,
but things got way too crazy. Then I wandered through parties and
bars until the last bar I was in threw everyone out at 3am. JavaOne
hasn't been this packed and frantic since the top of the dotcom
insanity. The opening keynote went through a pile of important
topics, including all of the new stuff in JavaEE 5, and the
"Project Tango" interoperability work that we're doing with
Microsoft. The coolest looking demo was <a href=
"https://aerith.dev.java.net/">Aerith</a>, an app built to showcase
all of the neat new things you can do in Swing and OpenGL, along
with integrating several web services. 

<p>Despite my panics over the infrastructure of the <a href=
"http://race.java.sun.com">slot car race programming challenge</a>,
it's running nicely and has a continuous crowd of people around it.
No one has broken the 25 second barrier yet, and most folks end up
sending their cars off into space. In the pre-runs we did at Sun in
the weeks before JavaOne, some folks were getting down to around 23
seconds. You have to be quite tricky. The prototype app just
adjusts the voltage in simple ways when the car passes over a
sensor. But you need to be making changes between sensors and doing
odd acceleration profiles -- like high acceleration followed by
momemtary hard braking; or graduated acceleration going through
curves. Loads of fun.</p>

<p>The JSR209 phone from <a href=
"http://www.savaje.com/">SavaJe</a> sold out almost instantly,
they're hoping to get more in.</p>

<p>*sigh* I have to head off to the next meeting...</p>
