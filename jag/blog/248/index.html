<div class=entry><h1>Solaris and OS X</h1>
I loved Tom Yeager's article <i><a href=
"http://weblog.infoworld.com/yager/archives/2007/10/">The next best
thing to OS X</a></i>. As several people have noticed at my talks
over the past few months, I no longer carry a Mac laptop. As much
as I love the Mac's eye candy, it really hasn't been keeping up as
a developer's machine - their attention has clearly been elsewhere.
Meanwhile, the Solaris folks have made huge strides in Solaris's
usability on a laptop with recent Nevada builds: the latest Gnome
is quite lovely. Firefox, Thunderbird and Lightning kick ass. The
new installer is totally slick. The nwam (network automagic)
service makes network hassles almost totally disappear. And Java,
NetBeans and Glassfish go like the wind! It's amazing how fast
things run. 

<p>And then there are all the cool Solaris goodies to take
advantage of. I'm totally addicted to Zones and ZFS. For example: I
have my laptop set up with ZFS managing the disk. Then I mirror the
laptop's disk onto a USB drive. When I'm wandering around with my
laptop disconnected, the filesystem runs in "degraded" mode - which
simply means that the mirror isn't up to date - it's as fast as
ever. But when I get back to my desk and the USB drive reconnects,
ZFS magically updates the mirror and I have an incredibly fast
backup. If I want to use backups for going back in time, ZFS
snapshots are perfect and <i>fast</i>.</p>

<p>There is one area that's a problem: when I close the lid on my
laptop, it keeps right on running. It doesn't suspend. I have to
manually shut the system down. I've been bugging the Solaris folks
about it for a while: they're working on getting there, but it'll
take awhile. In typical Solaris fashion, they're going for a "solve
world hunger" scale solution: last week I was at a talk about <a
href="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/project/tesla/">Tesla</a>, the
upcoming power management system. It'll be great when they're
done.</p>

<p>And no, I don't use any of the virtualization/multiboot
facilities: They all consume more performance and disk space than
I'm comfortable with.</p>
