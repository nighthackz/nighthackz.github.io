<div class=entry><h1>At the mercy of suppliers.</h1>
An interesting article came out in the New York Times about <a
href=
"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/29/technology/29dell.html?hp=&amp;pagewanted=all">Dell's
problems with capacitors from one of its suppliers . It really is
amazing the extent to which a company is at the mercy of its
suppliers. Despite all the effort that folks put into qualifying
their parts, there remains an unavoidable element of faith and
risk.</a>

<p>Sun had a series of such mishaps. The first I was involved in
involved CRT monitors that burst into flame. The deflection coils
of heavily used machines would overheat, the insulation would melt,
smoke, and for the truly unlucky, burst into flame. Paying to fix
all of the affected machines was hideously expensive. And even
though the monitor manufacturer shouldered a lot of the expense, it
was a near-death experience. But we got past it.</p>

<p>When Sun folks get together and bullshit about their theories of
why Sun died, the one that comes up most often is another one of
these supplier disasters. Towards the end of the DotCom bubble, we
introduced the UltraSPARC-II. Total killer product for large
datacenters. We sold lots. But then reports started coming in of
odd failures. Systems would crash strangely. We'd get crashes in
applications. All applications. Crashes in the kernel. Not very
often, but often enough to be problems for customers. Sun customers
were used to uptimes of years. The US-II was giving uptimes of
weeks. We couldn't even figure out if it was a hardware problem or
a software problem - Solaris had to be updated for the new machine,
so it could have been a kernel problem. But nothing was
reproducible. We'd get core dumps and spend hours pouring over
them. Some were just crazy, showing values in registers that were
simply impossible given the preceeding instructions. We tried
everything. Replacing processor boards. Replacing backplanes. It
was <i>deeply</i> random. It's very randomness suggested that maybe
it was a physics problem: maybe it was alpha particles or cosmic
rays. Maybe it was machines close to nuclear power plants. One site
experiencing problems was near Fermilab. We actually mapped out
failures geographically to see if they correlated to such particle
sources. Nope. In desperation, a bright hardware engineer decided
to measure the radioactivity of the systems themselves. Bingo!
Particles! But from where? Much detailed scanning and it turned out
that the packaging of the cache ram chips we were using was
noticeably radioactive. <a href=
"http://web.archive.org/web/20020202013942/http://www.computerworld.com/storyba/0,4125,NAV47_STO66102,00.html">We
switched suppliers and the problem totally went away . After two
years of tearing out hair out, we had a solution.</a></p>

<p>But it was too late. We had spent <i>billions</i> of dollars
keeping our customers running. Swapping out all of that hardware
was cripplingly expensive. But even worse, it severely damaged our
customers trust in our products. Our biggest customers had been
burned and were reluctant to buy again. It took quite a few years
to rebuild that trust. At about the time that it felt like we had
rebuilt trust and put the debacle behind us, the Financial Crisis
hit...</p>

<p>Boom.</p>

<p>I sure hope that Apple's iPhone4 antenna problem isn't another
such defining moment :-(</p>
