  "body" : "An interesting article came out in the New York Times about <a\nhref=\n\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/29/technology/29dell.html?hp=&amp;pagewanted=all\">Dell's\nproblems with capacitors from one of its suppliers . It really is\namazing the extent to which a company is at the mercy of its\nsuppliers. Despite all the effort that folks put into qualifying\ntheir parts, there remains an unavoidable element of faith and\nrisk.</a>\n\n<p>Sun had a series of such mishaps. The first I was involved in\ninvolved CRT monitors that burst into flame. The deflection coils\nof heavily used machines would overheat, the insulation would melt,\nsmoke, and for the truly unlucky, burst into flame. Paying to fix\nall of the affected machines was hideously expensive. And even\nthough the monitor manufacturer shouldered a lot of the expense, it\nwas a near-death experience. But we got past it.</p>\n\n<p>When Sun folks get together and bullshit about their theories of\nwhy Sun died, the one that comes up most often is another one of\nthese supplier disasters. Towards the end of the DotCom bubble, we\nintroduced the UltraSPARC-II. Total killer product for large\ndatacenters. We sold lots. But then reports started coming in of\nodd failures. Systems would crash strangely. We'd get crashes in\napplications. All applications. Crashes in the kernel. Not very\noften, but often enough to be problems for customers. Sun customers\nwere used to uptimes of years. The US-II was giving uptimes of\nweeks. We couldn't even figure out if it was a hardware problem or\na software problem - Solaris had to be updated for the new machine,\nso it could have been a kernel problem. But nothing was\nreproducible. We'd get core dumps and spend hours pouring over\nthem. Some were just crazy, showing values in registers that were\nsimply impossible given the preceeding instructions. We tried\neverything. Replacing processor boards. Replacing backplanes. It\nwas <i>deeply</i> random. It's very randomness suggested that maybe\nit was a physics problem: maybe it was alpha particles or cosmic\nrays. Maybe it was machines close to nuclear power plants. One site\nexperiencing problems was near Fermilab. We actually mapped out\nfailures geographically to see if they correlated to such particle\nsources. Nope. In desperation, a bright hardware engineer decided\nto measure the radioactivity of the systems themselves. Bingo!\nParticles! But from where? Much detailed scanning and it turned out\nthat the packaging of the cache ram chips we were using was\nnoticeably radioactive. <a href=\n\"http://web.archive.org/web/20020202013942/http://www.computerworld.com/storyba/0,4125,NAV47_STO66102,00.html\">We\nswitched suppliers and the problem totally went away . After two\nyears of tearing out hair out, we had a solution.</a></p>\n\n<p>But it was too late. We had spent <i>billions</i> of dollars\nkeeping our customers running. Swapping out all of that hardware\nwas cripplingly expensive. But even worse, it severely damaged our\ncustomers trust in our products. Our biggest customers had been\nburned and were reluctant to buy again. It took quite a few years\nto rebuild that trust. At about the time that it felt like we had\nrebuilt trust and put the debacle behind us, the Financial Crisis\nhit...</p>\n\n<p>Boom.</p>\n\n<p>I sure hope that Apple's iPhone4 antenna problem isn't another\nsuch defining moment :-(</p>\n\n",
