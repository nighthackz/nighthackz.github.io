  "body" : "I've had several emails lately from folks wondering why I haven't\ndone much blogging lately. Mostly it's because I've tried to stick\nto java-oriented technical topics, but life has been swamped by\nother things.\n\n<p>I spent several months involved in the Kodak trial. It was so\nbizarre. I so much wanted to rant about it (and I still do), but\nfor a pile of good reasons, it would be a bad idea. One of these\ndays one of the lawyers needs to write a detailed and accurate\narticle about what happened in that case. It was a horror from end\nto end. But I'm not the right one to write the story.</p>\n\n<p>Then there was the election. And then the horrible depression\nafterwards. I'm mostly out of that funk, thanks to some great\nhumour from <a href=\n\"http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2004/11/03/notes110304.DTL&amp;nl=fix\"\n shape=\"rect\">Mark</a> <a href=\n\"http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/gate/archive/2004/11/10/notes111004.DTL\"\n shape=\"rect\">Morford</a>, <a href=\n\"http://sorryeverybody.com/gallery/1/\" shape=\n\"rect\">SorryEverybody</a>, a <a href=\"http://www.fuckthesouth.com/\"\nshape=\"rect\">damn yankee</a>, and a whole lot of others. I realized\nI was in trouble when I noticed that I was thinking of <a href=\n\"http://michaelmoore.com/\" shape=\"rect\">Michael Moore</a> as a\nvoice of reason.</p>\n\n<p>I'm better now. Back to being a geek.</p>\n\n",
