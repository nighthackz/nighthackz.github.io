<td valign=top class=content><div class=entry><h1>What's happened to my blog?</h1>
I've had several emails lately from folks wondering why I haven't
done much blogging lately. Mostly it's because I've tried to stick
to java-oriented technical topics, but life has been swamped by
other things.

<p>I spent several months involved in the Kodak trial. It was so
bizarre. I so much wanted to rant about it (and I still do), but
for a pile of good reasons, it would be a bad idea. One of these
days one of the lawyers needs to write a detailed and accurate
article about what happened in that case. It was a horror from end
to end. But I'm not the right one to write the story.</p>

<p>Then there was the election. And then the horrible depression
afterwards. I'm mostly out of that funk, thanks to some great
humour from <a href=

shape="rect">damn yankee</a>, and a whole lot of others. I realized
I was in trouble when I noticed that I was thinking of <a href=
"http://michaelmoore.com/" shape="rect">Michael Moore</a> as a
voice of reason.</p>

<p>I'm better now. Back to being a geek.</p>
