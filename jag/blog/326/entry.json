  "body" : "I went to a little going away party for <a href=\n\"http://weblogs.java.net/blog/kohsuke/archive/2010/04/05/good-bye-sunoracle\">Kohsuke\nKawaguchi</a>. He's the fellow that started (and has written most\nof the code for) <a href=\"http://hudson-ci.org/\">Hudson</a>, a\nreally great continuous integration server. It's totally extensible\nand can do everything from automating builds, running test suites,\ncollecting benchmarks, monitoring development status/health to\nmonitoring any kind of external execution (like procmail). He\nstarted working on Hudson as a spare-time personal project, then it\nbecame his day job (one of his day jobs, anyway). It's changed the\nway that I and many others do software development. This isn't the\nend of Hudson, it's a new birth: KK's starting a new company around\nHudson. You can contact him at <a href=\"http://kohsuke.org/\">his\npersonal site</a>\n",
