  "body" : "At home I use ZFS+NFS on a Solaris box to make a file server that\nprovides disk space to all the other machines at home, which are\nmostly MACs. I use NFS to access the files instead of AFS because\nit's so much faster. A friend and I were talking about this over\nthe weekend and he was surprised: OS X is notoriously tricky to\nconfigure to use NFS. They have a nonstandard way to manage\nautomount maps and, unusual for Apple: no easy-to-use front end. So\nlots of folks stay away from using NFS on OSX. It turns out that\nthere's a trick that not many folks know about that makes it easy:\n(almost) no configuration required. The default NFS configuration\ncontains a default automount map based on hostnames:\n/net/<i>hostname</i>/<i>filepath</i>. The tricky bit is that the\nfinder suppresses the \"/net\" directory so you can only see it from\nthe Unix shell. From the shell on OS X, /net references work with\nno effort: \n<pre>\nls /net/10.0.0.123/tank/photos\n</pre>\nLists all the files in /tank/photos on the host with IP address\n10.0.0.123 (if you're feeling adventurous, you can associate a name\nwith the address by appropriate configuration of the naming\nenvironment, but that can be a pain, so I often just use naked\nstatic addresses). To make this work with finder in OS X, just do\nthis from the shell: \n<pre>\nsudo ln -s /net/10.0.0.123 /tank\n</pre>\nThen \"tank\" will show up on the root filesystem, and \"photos\" will\nbe visible within it. The only configuration I do is this one\nsymlink, then all the filesystems on the server appear. Easy.\n",
