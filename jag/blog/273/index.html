<td valign=top class=content><div class=entry><h1>Wednesday at JavaOne: what a ride!</h1>
Yesterday was totally packed. Absolutely no rest for the wicked :-)
Lots of great interactions with all sorts of folks, some in
organized meetings, but most just random chats in the hallways. I
love the energy that is everywhere. 

<p>I helped take a group of University and High School students on
a tour through the pavilion. For all the appeal of "virtual
reality", it was the "real reality" stuff that grabbed them most:
the realtime control demo, Tommy, and the blu-ray/streaming media
got lots of questions.</p>

<p>I spent an hour with the Dutch JUG. It was great during the
opening on Tuesday morning when John Gage made a comment about the
Brazilians being uninhibited extroverts, and how the rest of the
audience should be honorary Brazilians... About 80 members of the
Dutch jug lept up with a huge banner and let out a roar that put
the Brazilians to shame. There's definitely some national
competition brewing here.</p>

<p>I ended the formal part of my day with a short walk-on during
the AMD keynote. I got to spend some time talking about how amazing
the HotSpot optimizer has become and what a good job it does of
exploiting the special features of CPUs. I ended my bit with a
tongue-in-cheek one-liner that was roughly "now we're going after
Fortran". When I got off the stage, Denis Caromel from INRIA came
up to me and said "you're already done": he had just finished some
extensive benchmarking of Java for HPC and his results were
impressive. Thanks!</p>

<p>This was followed by an extensive pub-crawl :-( Now I'm off to
rehearsals for my keynote tomorrow. The Toy Show is going to be
very cool.</p>

<p>Lame joke: when you're standing outside a theatre as a showing
of Iron Man is letting out, how do you tell who the real geeks are?
They're the ones lusting after Tony Stark's workshop.</p>
