  "body" : "Yesterday was totally packed. Absolutely no rest for the wicked :-)\nLots of great interactions with all sorts of folks, some in\norganized meetings, but most just random chats in the hallways. I\nlove the energy that is everywhere. \n\n<p>I helped take a group of University and High School students on\na tour through the pavilion. For all the appeal of \"virtual\nreality\", it was the \"real reality\" stuff that grabbed them most:\nthe realtime control demo, Tommy, and the blu-ray/streaming media\ngot lots of questions.</p>\n\n<p>I spent an hour with the Dutch JUG. It was great during the\nopening on Tuesday morning when John Gage made a comment about the\nBrazilians being uninhibited extroverts, and how the rest of the\naudience should be honorary Brazilians... About 80 members of the\nDutch jug lept up with a huge banner and let out a roar that put\nthe Brazilians to shame. There's definitely some national\ncompetition brewing here.</p>\n\n<p>I ended the formal part of my day with a short walk-on during\nthe AMD keynote. I got to spend some time talking about how amazing\nthe HotSpot optimizer has become and what a good job it does of\nexploiting the special features of CPUs. I ended my bit with a\ntongue-in-cheek one-liner that was roughly \"now we're going after\nFortran\". When I got off the stage, Denis Caromel from INRIA came\nup to me and said \"you're already done\": he had just finished some\nextensive benchmarking of Java for HPC and his results were\nimpressive. Thanks!</p>\n\n<p>This was followed by an extensive pub-crawl :-( Now I'm off to\nrehearsals for my keynote tomorrow. The Toy Show is going to be\nvery cool.</p>\n\n<p>Lame joke: when you're standing outside a theatre as a showing\nof Iron Man is letting out, how do you tell who the real geeks are?\nThey're the ones lusting after Tony Stark's workshop.</p>\n\n",
