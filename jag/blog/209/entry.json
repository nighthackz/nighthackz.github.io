  "body" : "Tom Andrews asked \"<i>:-( I always really liked the T-shirt\nhurling. If real software people make their own hardware, really\nserious software people make their own potentially dangerous\nhardware. Tell us Jim - did the fire regs finally get too strict?\nHave they banned indoor rockets?</i>\". \n\n<p>The fire regs have been pretty constant. They've squashed some\nreally good entries. Last year we had an entrant using a chain saw\nwhich got squashed at the last moment because the fire marshal\nwouldn't accept the engine exhaust, so an electric chain saw had to\nbe substituted: just not the same. In a previous year one proposal\nthat I fought ahrd for was for a traditional Indonesian cannon used\nat festivals to shoot confetti into crowds. It was made of bamboo\nand fueled with kerosene. Totally wonderful, but it freaked the\nfire marshal.</p>\n\n<p>The issue really was just timing. I was out for too long. I\nguarantee that there will be no shortage of <i>potentially\ndangerous hardware :-)</i> at JavaOne this year. The schedule is\njammed.</p>\n\n",
