<div class=entry><h1>My Grandmother, the Zen Master</h1>
It was my grandmother's 98th birthday on Tuesday. I realized a long
time ago that she was really a Zen Master, without knowing it. A
few weeks ago I was in an engineering discussion with someone and
made a comment that I don't remember, but they commented in reply
"How very Zen of you". In truth, all I was doing was parroting my
grandmother. 

<p>My grandmother was born in Iceland and lived alone with her
mother. When my grandmother was 14 (1918) her mother died and she
sold everything (which wasn't much) bought a boat ticket to Canada
and a few years later (having spent some time with relatives in
Dafoe Saskatchewan) found herself married to my grandfather and
living in Banff Alberta. They ran the first ski resort in the
Canadian Rockies and brought in the first ski lift - this wasn't
much by today's standards, literally a log cabin and a rope
tow.</p>

<p>Mountains, snow, skiing, ... they were her life. 25ish years ago
there was a party held in Banff by a bunch of old-timers to
celebrate my grandparents 50th wedding anniversary. The stories
they told were really hair-raising. I wish I had written them down.
One of her sons, my uncle Gordon, was on the Canadian Olympic ski
team. My parents met skiing. Needless to say, I'm the anti-jock of
the family. I didn't inherit any of their skill.</p>

<p>Where does "Zen" fit in? I suppose I could have titled this
entry "All I Really Need to Know I Learned while Skiing with my
Grandmother". She didn't use many words. She wasn't really into
detailed explainations. Just short aphorisms. The interesting thing
about aphorisms is that the listener applies a lot of
interpretation and can re-apply them. There are three things she
said to me over and over again that, while she was talking about
skiing, can easily be applied to engineering and life in
general:</p>

<blockquote>
  <b>Balance</b>. I'd come roaring down the hill and she'd yell
  "Balance, James! Balance!" "Keep your weight centered". This one
  echoes through my head every day. 

  <p>Even if she hadn't seen me ski down the hill, I'd come up to
  her and she'd often say "<b>James, you're breathing too hard. You
  must be doing something wrong</b>." If it didn't look effortless,
  you hadn't learned it yet. My engineering reinterpretation of
  this is essentially the old Blaise Pascal quote: "I apologize for
  the length of this letter, but I didn't have time to make it
  shorter." Take the time.</p>

  <p>The most inscrutable was "<b>Follow your breathing!</b>" When
  you come skiing down a hill there's a rhythm to the turns. As
  you're making a turn there's tension in your leg muscles. In
  between turns, the tension releases. To do it right, you have to
  coordinate your whole body's muscle tension. A big part of this
  is your torso - and in particular the chest muscles involved in
  breathing. When you take ski lessons they often tell you to
  breath out when you're in a turn - this is so that your chest
  muscles are tense when your leg muscles are tense. Many people
  end up doing this by seeing when they need to turn, and arranging
  to breath out then. My grandmother turned this around: she let
  her body breath at it's own natural rhythm, and she just turned
  whenever she exhaled. Listen for the natural rhythms of life and
  follow them. Go with the flow. When engineering, don't just come
  up with some cool technology and jam it in to the solution of
  some problem. Think about the problem and its context first and
  let it lead you. Inspiration is 99% Observation.</p>
</blockquote>It was humbling being a 20ish stud wannabee skiing
with my 70ish grandmother and realizing that I would never be as
graceful and fluid as she was, even at that age. 

<p>Her name is Margaret Carolyn Morrison (born Kar&#243;l&#237;na
Margr&#233;t Sveinsd&#243;ttir).</p>
