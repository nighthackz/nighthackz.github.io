  "body" : "There's a wonderful company, <a href=\"http://www.octavo.com\" shape=\n\"rect\">Octavo</a> that reproduces rare manuscripts on CDROM. I\nactually have a subscription to their CDROM-of-the-month (or\nwhenever). The one I most recently received is particularly\nspectacular. It's a compendum of <a href=\n\"http://www.octavo.com/collections/projects/duruwm/index.html\"\nshape=\"rect\">two books</a> by Albrecht D&#252;rer on the scientific\nprinciples of art technique. The section on perspective has great\nillustrations that would fit well in any book on ray tracing\nalgorithms. \n\n<p>Everything new is old. The past is filled with great shoulders\nto stand on.</p>\n\n",
