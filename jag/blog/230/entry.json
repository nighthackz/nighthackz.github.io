  "body" : "Somehow, JavaOne as once again been a complete blur. My promises to\nmyself to blog more often haven't worked out. With all the talks,\npress, analysts, customers, friends, server meltdowns and general\nrunning around, there just aren't enough hours in a day. Some folks\ntried real hard to get me to the AfterDark party last night, but\nno: I had to rehearse for this morning. This JavaOne has truly been\ndifferent. \n\n<p>My keynote is both easy and hard: it's all demos. All stuff that\nI think is inspiring. All stuff that makes me think \"Could I switch\njobs with you?\". But it's long. Two hours, 12 demos.</p>\n\n",
