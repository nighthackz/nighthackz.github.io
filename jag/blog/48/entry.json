  "body" : "We just did the first t-shirt toss contestant. This was the team\nfrom VisiComp that did a nitrogen powered cannon. A seriously out\nof control mechanism. Quite capable of hitting the far back wall of\nthe hall. In one of life's little techno-tragedies, the battery in\nmy camera died just before the cannon firing. This is a photo of\nthe cannon with its nitrogen cannister a couple of weeks ago, just\nafter it was built.\n",
