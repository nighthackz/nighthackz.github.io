But there's (almost) no such thing as a software\nengineering project that comes in on time, so we'll be willing to\naccept entries for another week: you've got until March 22nd to\ncome up with a cool way to hurl a t-shirt into an audience. That\ncool idea you had bubbling in the back of your head still has a\nchance to get out and impress your fellow geeks. Forget all of\nthose urgent things that are stopping you from doing something\ntruly important: write up your entry and send it in! \n\n<p>Thanks to all of you who did manage to get your entries in on\ntime: I'm amazed!</p>\n\n",
