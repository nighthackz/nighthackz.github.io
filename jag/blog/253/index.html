<td valign=top class=content><div class=entry><h1>Cell phones in Japan</h1>
One of the things that's always interesting about visiting Japan is
looking at all of their cell phones. I've seen some great things
here on this visit. 

<p>One was a very cool phone that flips open on the long side,
something like a Nintendo DS - and in a piece of cool mechanical
engineering, it can flip open on the orthogonal edge, just like a
conventional flip phone. It has a lovely hardware implementation of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_ES">OpenGL/ES</a> and
does truly impressive 3D graphics. Fluid frame rates, great
modeling and texturing, ... a great handheld game machine. The
games I played were great - and Java! Distributed multiplayer
gaming - challenge your friend to a road race while you're both
commuting on the train - and on different trains.</p>

<p>One of the games was a bowling game that you play roughly the
same way that you'd use a Nintendo WII: you hold the phone as
though it's a bowling ball, and you go through the motions of
throwing the ball. You use a button press to release the ball. When
this happens, it does the physics. But the phone doesn't have
accelerometers to measure how you move the phone. They used one of
the most glorious hacks I've seen in years: images are captured by
the camera as you swing it in your hand, which are then analysed
and correlated and motion vectors are computed from the interframe
deltas.</p>

<p>The most impressive thing I've seen is the use of cell phones
for money. I see people all over Tokyo paying for everything from
groceries in minimarts to airplane tickets by holding their phones
up to cash registers. This is done by having a proximity
stored-value smart-card chip embedded in the skin of the phone.
These cryptographically secure chips can do transactions with
point-of-sale terminals instantaneously, no matter how slow the
network is, or even if it is down. It is very much like the
stored-value smart-cards that have been used around the world for
years. But having them embedded in the skin of a cell phone has
some great advantages, stemming from the Java APIs that allow
direct communication between the stored-value chip and the phone.
This allows a variety of banking and commerce applications to be
built. For example, to put more money into the stored-value chip,
you don't have to go to a bank kiosk, you can do it directly over
the network from the phone. You can also do Quicken-style
check-writing and budgeting - directly from the phone. All Java
apps. As a bonus, if you lose your phone (or it gets stolen) you
can call up the phone company and (after a few security questions)
they can lock the phone remotely and use the network's
location-awareness capabilities to tell you roughly where the phone
is. (Privacy freaks: explode now...).</p>

<p>Plus... You can use your cell phone to book airplane (and train)
tickets, and use the cell phone itself as both the ticket
<b>and</b> the boarding pass. Zero paper. To check in, you just
swipe your phone on a reader as you're dashing to your seat. Very
fast and secure.</p>

<p><b>[Update</b> <i>in response to <a href=
"http://human-begin.blogspot.com/">flavin</a>'s comment about the
design of JavaME:</i> In fact, the situation is quite the opposite:
the evolution of JavaME is heavily driven by the capabilities of
international carriers and phone manufacturers. It's a huge
frustration to American JavaME developers that they can read about
all of these cool APIs (like OpenGL/ES), but the available systems
don't support them<b>]</b></p>
