They have Java VMs in their big printers\nthat enable developers to build applications into the printers.\nThey are often specialized workflow management apps. If you were at\nJavaOne, you saw a simple (but valuable) one: print a document from\nyour laptop, it goes to a master spool server, then walk over to\nany printer, stick in your badge, and out comes your document. When\neverything is on the network, the possibilities for end-to-end\nsynergies are endless [Yuck: on re-reading that sentence, it's\npretty clear that I've been spending too much time with\nmarketoids].\n",
