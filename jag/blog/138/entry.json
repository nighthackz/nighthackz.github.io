  "body" : "We've been holding a big Java event in China for the past couple of\ndays, following NetBeans day on Monday. JavaChina is roughly\nsimilar to JavaOne. We had about 8000 addendees who've been through\ntwo days of intense training sessions. I've been doing so much\ntalking to so many groups that my throat needs a retread. Really\ncool. There's a great developer community here in China. The low\npoint was when I started my main talk in a 4000 seat room stuffed\nto the rafters, the slides that came up on the screen were totally\nwrong: they were the ones for a talk I gave last week in St\nPetersburg. The big photo of a Russian Orthodox cathedral on the\nfirst slide was a big surprise. 10 minutes of vamping later, the\nstage crew finally got it sorted out [Thanks Bob!]. *blush*\n",
