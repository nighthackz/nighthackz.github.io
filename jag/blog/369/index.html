<td valign=top class=content><div class=entry><h1>ACE revisited</h1>
Quite a few years ago I built a system called <a href=
"resource/ace.pdf">ACE - the Algorithm Composition Engine</a>. It
was both a success and a failure that contains a pile of ideas that
have nagged me ever since. It was roughly a macro preprocessor like
CPP, except that it delt in parse trees instead of characters. 

<p>Ace's equivalent of a macro was based on a pattern match in a
parse tree rather than a token match in a characters stream. So one
could write:</p>
<pre>
$replace $0*2; $with $0&lt;&lt;1;
</pre>
The most powerful function in ACE was <tt>$tradeoff(a,b)</tt> which
took as parameters two code fragments that were assumed to perform
the same computation. Tradeoff would compute time and space
estimates for each code fragment, then choose one or the other
based on the probability of reaching that point. ACE was fed branch
probabilities and loop lap-counts to compute an expected execution
count for each point in the program. For tradeoff, if one code
fragment was large and slow, and the other was small and fast, the
choice is clear. More commonly one is large and fast, the other is
small and slow. If the expected execution count was low, the small
and slow version would be picked, otherwise the large and fast
version would be picked. ACE essentially had a dial that let the
developer say "give me the fastest version of this function that
fit in N bytes". 

<p>The parameters to tradeoff were usually based on different <a
href=
"entry/refactoring_considered_harmful_sometimes.html">performance
motivated refactorings.</a> These could usually be done cleanly
using ACE, as described in <a href="resource/ace.pdf">the
paper</a>.</p>

<p>ACE was very successful in that it made it possible for us to
write simple clean code for high performance algorithms that was
robust and flexible. The downside was that very few developers
could figure out how to use it. It was a very different way to
think about coding. I came to think of ACE as a complete failure
when I visited the group again to answer some questions about old
pieces of code and I discovered that instead of fixing problems in
the input to ACE, they had taken the output from ACE (which was
just plain C code) and checked it into the source repository,
throwing away the preprocessor and it's input files.</p>

<p>In later years I wrote yet another rule engine as a part of what
became the Jackpot plugin for NetBeans. It's syntax was a little
more humane and a lot more powerful:</p>
<pre>
$a/2 =&gt; $a&gt;&gt;1 :  $a instanceof int &amp;&amp; $a&gt;=0
</pre>
Read "=&gt;" as "becomes" and ":" as "where". The "where" clause
allowed boolean predicates based on type and value inferencing. The
predicates used a three state logic: true/false/maybe. For every
point in a program Jackpot maintained a set of
things-known-to-be-true. This most commonly came from <b>if</b>
statements. Following <tt>if(b)</tt> b was known-to-be-true in the
<b>then</b> clause, and !b was known-to-be-true in the <b>else</b>
clause. It wasn't good enough for anyone in the theorem-proving
community to find respectable, but it was good enough to be
remarkably useful (I'm a huge fan of "good enough"). 

<p>The parser in both ACE and Jackpot was somewhat lenient.
Particularly in ACE, this was used in a manner similar to how
closures are used in languages like Scala and Ruby to create what
look like new statements. But they were much more powerful because
it was possible to introspect on the body in a very detailed way.
Writing a set of transformation rules that would construct a <a
href="entry/equations_and_methods.html">Newton's-method
function</a> from an equation was possible in ACE.</p>

<p>Food for thought.</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> One reader commented:</p>

<blockquote>
  These map precisely to Scala pattern-match expressions: $replace
  $0*2; $with $0&lt;&lt;1; could look like: case Mul(a,Num(2))
  =&gt; LeftShift(a, 1) and $a/2 =&gt; $a&gt;&gt;1 : $a instanceof
  int &amp;&amp; $a&gt;=0 would be case Div(a,2) if
  a.isInstanceOf[Int] &amp;&amp; a &gt;= 0 except that it seems
  like the predicate in ACE could be evaluated lazily on a
  per-execution basis if I understand correctly.
</blockquote>This is roughly correct, but the "could be evaluated
lazily" point is crucial. The really hard part in these systems is
getting them to perform. Jackpot would take thousands of rules and
compile them down to optimized inline code that was extremely fast.
To understand how this worked, read up on database query
optimization and the constructive equivalence of deterministic and
non-deterministic finite state automata. In jackpot the rule
matcher's performance was (almost) independent of the number of
rules or their complexity. Applying thousands of rules to millions
of lines of code worked remarkably well. 

<p>Also, both exploited algebraic transformations in matching. For
example, !(a&lt;b) was matched by the same patterns as a&gt;=b</p>
