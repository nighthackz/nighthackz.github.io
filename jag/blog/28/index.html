<td valign=top class=content><div class=entry><h1>The Sun/Microsoft settlement</h1>
Since the announcement of Sun's settlement with Microsoft over
Java, there has been a lot of rampant speculation echoing back and
forth over the net. A lot of it reads like bad conspiracy-theory
stuff. People have been reading between the lines and making stuff
up. This echos around the rumor mill and gains the appearance of
fact. I'd like to try to set the record straight on a number of
points: 

<ul>
  <li>
    In Rick Ross's <a href=
    "http://www.javalobby.org/nl/archive/jlnews_20040406o.html"
    shape="rect">Where Is Java In This Settlement?</a> he worries
    that Sun may have sold out the Java community. We didn't. We
    have not sold our soul to the Dark Side. We haven't overnight
    turned into mindless lap dogs. We've had a lot of experience
    with Microsoft over the years, and it has made us very
    cautious.

    <p>One of his big concerns was about the departure of Rich
    Green, which the rumour mills say left Sun in disgust (as
    reported in The Register). This is unbelievably far from the
    truth. Rich Green was my boss, I was with him day after day.
    Rich worked very hard to make this agreement happen. He left in
    relief, happy that things were settled in a way that left him
    with a clear conscience and a sense of closure. In fact he (and
    I, and many others) felt that concluding the suit was good for
    Sun, good for the industry, and good for the Java community. He
    left for entirely independent reasons that have nothing to do
    with Sun and had really been hanging in to make sure that the
    court cases got settled right. He still has good relationships
    with everyone at Sun and left on a very friendly basis. He will
    be missed by all of us, and will remain a visible presence in
    the industry.</p>

    <p>Farther down in the article Rick characterizes Microsoft as
    having paid off Apple to "abandon its commitment to Java
    compatibility". I use Apple's OS X every day, and I work with
    folks at Apple all the time: their commitment to Java
    compatibility is very real.</p>

    <p>One thing he says that I agree with is where he says "How
    can Sun show us that it still has the strength, vision and
    leadership to deserve our support and loyalty? The way they
    should do it, in my opinion, is by ensuring that a significant
    portion of the settlement proceeds will be used to benefit Java
    developers and strengthen independent, standards-based efforts
    to advance Java.". This is exactly what's being done. Our
    investment in and commitment to Java is very strong.</p>

    <p>We fought hard to win those court cases. And we did win.
    Bigtime. Finally getting them cleared up gives us an extra pile
    of cash to invest in moving forward, it stops sucking the life
    out of all of us who dedicated enormous amounts of time to the
    cause, and it frees us from all sorts of procedural
    entanglements that were a part of the litigation process. This
    settlement is a <i>Very Good Thing</i>.</p>

    There's a long thread of discussion on Slashdot <a href=
    "http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/04/12/1245208&amp;mode=flat&amp;tid=102&amp;tid=108&amp;tid=123&amp;tid=126&amp;tid=156&amp;tid=187&amp;tid=99"
     shape="rect">Two Takes on the Java Dilemma</a> that is pretty
    entertaining, from a <i>wow, what are they smoking!</i> point
    of view. There are voices of reason, and conspiracy nuts. There
    are so many comments that it's impossible to go through them
    all. I'll just address a couple near the top: Java is most
    definitely <b>not</b> for sale. Not to IBM, not to anyone. 

    <p>There are a set of postings in that thread that aren't
    directly about Java, they're about Unix and x86:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <i>Yes, Intel x86 can handle many of the tasks that only Unix
      machines used to be able to handle. I'd just tend to debate
      whether they're capable of doing these tasks as cost
      effectively, as reliably, and as efficiently.</i> 

      <p>Well judging by the amount of people dropping their old
      UNIX gear, and taking up rackfulls of AMD or Intel boxes
      (especially the new 64bit offerings), i'd say the answer to
      that is a big YES.</p>
    </blockquote>This is a bizarre comparison because x86 is a CPU
    architecture, and Unix is an operating system family: they are
    not the same things! All the Unix flavors run perfectly well on
    x86. Yes: Linux is a Unix flavor. Where this relates to Java
    and Sun is that because such a huge fraction of customer
    applications that run on Sun hardware is written in Java, we
    can treat CPUs (and even operating systems) as commodities, in
    the same way we treat disk drives. We can use whatever
    underlying CPU technology (x86/x86-64/Sparc/...) or OS
    technology (Solaris/Linux/...) is most suitable for the
    situation at hand. We aren't constrained by the instruction set
    or OS interface that is baked into our customers' applications.
    This is <i>hugely</i> liberating for hardware design.

    As for Richard Stallman's <a href=
    "http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=04/04/07/2021242"
    shape="rect">Free but shackled: The Java trap</a> , it's hard
    to know where to begin. He has his own rather peculiar
    definition of "Free" that I think violates the First Law of
    Thermodynamics (energy is conserved): developers put a huge
    amount of energy into creating software and if they can't get
    that energy back in a way that balances, then the system falls
    apart. I've been in this discussion countless times and I'd
    like to avoid landing there again. GPL software is not "free":
    it comes with a license that has a strong political agenda.
    Like GPL software, the Java platform is "free" in many senses:
    you don't have to pay anything for the runtime or developers
    kit and you can get the sources for everything. Unlike GPLd
    software, the Java sources don't come with a viral infection
    clause that requires you to apply the GPL to your own code. But
    the sources for the JDK do come with a license that has a
    different catch: redistribution requires compatibility testing.
    

    <p>This is just context for the real point I want to make: when
    you have platform software like Linux or the JDK, the platform
    interface (in the case of Java, the VM and API specifications)
    divides the world of developers into two groups: those who work
    under the interface to implement it, and those who work above
    the interface and build applications based on it. These two
    communities have needs that conflict. In particular, a blanket
    freedom for developers under the interface, to do whatever they
    damn well please, is incredibly disruptive and damaging to
    developers above the interface. The catch in the Sun Java
    source license is all about defending the needs of developers
    who work above the interface. This ends up being constraining
    to folks who work under the interface, but in a way that is
    hugely beneficial to those who work above. We believe that for
    a developer who has built a Java application they have a right
    to trust that when some other developer says "I have a Java VM
    for you to use", that their application will work.</p>

    <p>So yes, like the GPL, our source license does have an
    agenda. It's not a hidden one, and we believe it's a very
    beneficial one (at least, to application developers!).</p>
  </li>

  <li>There has been a big debate about implementation languages in
  the Gnome world. It's been all over the map, but one point of
  concern has been a set of formless dreads about the usability of
  the Java language specification. We've been very clear about
  this, but it seems like few have read the spec: if you look in
  the frontmatter, it contains an explicit statement that anyone is
  free to implement the specification. It goes much farther than
  most other specification documents: it actually includes a patent
  rights grant.</li>
</ul>We're not a bunch of moronic secret subversive Microsoft
lapdogs. We've worked very hard over the years to fairly balance
the needs of all the various communities. Relax. Have a little
faith.
