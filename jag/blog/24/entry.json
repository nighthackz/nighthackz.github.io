To spice things\nup a little I've decided to try an experiment to boost the prize\nmoney: there is <a href=\"http://cafeshops.com/duketoss\" shape=\n\"rect\">official t-shirt hurling contest merchandise for sale at\ncafeshops.com</a>. A portion of the sale price of each article goes\ninto the prize pot. Even if you're not entering, you can at least\nsupport it by buying a goofy shirt.\n",
