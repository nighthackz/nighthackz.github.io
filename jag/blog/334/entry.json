  "body" : "Despite being \"blissfully unemployed\", I've been remarkably busy.\nSome of my time has been taken up by job hunting, some by a fun\ngeek project (more on that in a later post), but an awful lot has\nbeen taken up talking to people about life at Oracle. They need a\nplace to vent, and I try to be a good listener. The exodus has been\na thundering stampede. Pretty soon, all Larry will have left is an\nIP portfolio. Perhaps that's all he wanted: there's precious little\nevidence that he was interested in any of the people. Early on\nafter quitting, I kept waking up in the middle of the night having\nnightmares about composing screeching blog entries. They would have\nbeen fun, but pointless. I decided that it was finally time to do\nsome real relaxing and spend some quality time with a beach and an\nocean - I figured I needed to do it before the poison that BP's\nbeen dumping kills much more. I had a great time. Got back last\nnight. Feeling hugely better.\n",
