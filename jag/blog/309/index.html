<img align=right src='Gun.jpg.png'>I don't know what it is about Apple and NFS, but they keep moving
things around. The new UI to NFS mounting is much nicer than it was
before, but it's now in a totally different place: the Disk
Utility. But if you use a lot of NFS file systems, it's a pain to
have to mount them one by one: ignoring the UI and using the /net
automount filesystem is far more convenient. Just use the file name
<tt>/net/</tt><i>hostname</i><tt>/</tt><i>path</i> and you don't
have to mess with any mounting, it just happens by automagic. I
wrote a blog entry about this a long time ago. 

<p>However, there is a huge problem with this: OS X does a
phenominal amount of file locking (some would say, needlessly so)
and has always been really sensitive to the configuration of
locking on the NFS servers. So much so that if you randomly pick an
NFS server in a large enterprise, true success is pretty unlikely.
It'll succeed, but you'll keep getting messages indicating that the
lock server is down, followed quickly by another message that the
lock server is back up again. Even if you do get the NFS server
tuned precisely the way that OS X wants it, performance sucks
because of all the lock/unlock protocol requests that fly across
the network. They clearly did something in Snow Leopard to
aggravate this problem: it's now nasty enough to make NFS almost
useless for me.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there is a fix: just turn off network locking. You
can do it by adding the "nolocks,locallocks" options in the
advanced options field of the Disk Utility NFS mounting UI, but
this is painful if you do a lot of them, and doesn't help at all
with /net. You can edit /etc/auto_master to add these options to
the /net entry, but it doesn't affect other mounts - however I do
recommend deleting the <tt>hidefromfinder</tt> option in
auto_master. If you want to fix every automount, edit
/etc/autofs.conf and search for the line that starts with
<tt>AUTOMOUNTD_MNTOPTS=</tt>. These options get applied on every
mount. Add <tt>nolocks,locallocks</tt> and your world will be
faster and happier after you reboot.</p>
