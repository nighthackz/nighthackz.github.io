  "body" : "There have been a few reports out about me moving from the labs to\nthe sun tools organization. Yes, it's true. It's been about a week\nnow. It's kinda wierd having a \"real job\" again. But very cool. Now\nI'm not just kibbitzing on the side in the Sun Tools strategy, I'm\ndeep in it. One piece I'm very interested in is taking some of the\npieces of the Jackpot project and using them in products. Jackpot\nhas been a lot of fun, but it's gone beyond being a science\nproject: the underlying sematic modeling techniques have proven to\nwork very well. Now I get to work on turning the toys into real\ntools. And there is so much to do: from rapid application\ndevelopment to development for embedded systems, there's a lot of\nterritory out there.\n",
