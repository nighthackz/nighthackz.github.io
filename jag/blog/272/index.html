<div class=entry><h1>What a day...</h1>
First things first, a couple of things to check out: 

<ul>
  <li>Track down the real-time demo in the pavilion (the one with
  all the colored balls shooting around) and see if you've run the
  lottery :-) The prize is dinner with me and Greg Bollella on
  Thursday.</li>

  <li>The Gemalto folks are running a coding contest: you write a
  control algorithm for a tank that drives around a field filled
  with other tanks. Whoever dies last wins. The interesting catch
  is that the code you write has to run on a smart card...</li>
</ul>What a rush yesterday was. I had promised myself that I'd blog
a couple of times during the day, but there was no way that was
going to work... 

<p>The day started off with a bang shooting t-shirts into the
audience with John Gage and Chris Melissinos. It's remarkable how
good a job the big 3-person slingshot does. Totally low tech, but
very physical and theatrical. We did a cooperative opening of the
show. I mostly talked about how the show was instrumented using
motes from <a href="http://www.sentilla.com/javaone">Sentilla</a>.
If you have a "maker" itch to scratch, they're selling cool
developer kit.</p>

<p>If you're looking for another cool toy to spend money on, check
out the LiveScribe pen. When I first heard about it (a JVM in a
pen? WTF?) it seemed like an odd thing to do, but when you go
through some of their usage scenarios, it's totally brilliant.</p>

<p>My keynote isn't until Friday, so I got to just sit and watch
Rich Green's keynote. Lots of nice demos, but the sphere of
interactive media streams had me in awe. Between the efforts of the
JavaFX, graphics and Hotspot teams, it got amazing performance.
Having the keynote end with <a href=
"http://java.sun.com/javaone/sf/media_shell.jsp?id=FRdamp267542">Neil
Young being a geek</a> for 15 minutes was pretty damned cool. He's
a fan of blu-ray and is in the midst of a big project using it.</p>

<p>The bulk of the day was press interviews, videotaping and time
with customers. They'd describe problems they're having and I'd get
this surreal deja vu feeling "But we fixed that in JDKn"... "*sob*
we're stuck in JDKm(&lt;n)" *sigh*</p>

<p>The work day ended up with the <a href=
"http://blogs.sun.com/duke/">Dukes Choice</a> award ceremony. Once
again, it was really hard to choose the winners. There is so much
great stuff being done by the community. If you come to my keynote
on Friday, several of them will be doing demos.</p>

<p>The day was closed with a traditional pub crawl...</p>

<p>The design for this years t-shirt came out rather well:<br>
