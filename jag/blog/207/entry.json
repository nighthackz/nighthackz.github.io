I totaly agree with you. But with the\n  release of Java under open source these kind of debates will be\n  come more often. This is the top reason I would hoped Java would\n  stayed non open source.</p>\n\n  <p>Sun should stay in control on the language feature, but others\n  may vote for there favorite language feature.</p>\n\n  <p>Giving everyone control over the languages features is a bad\n  idea and may lead to the end of the langue.</p>\n\n  <p>Welcome to the dark side of open source.</p>\n</blockquote>I didn't mean that I don't like the debate. What I\ndon't like is debate divorced from experiment and data. Language\narguments can get into all sorts of handwaving without building\nsample implementations. What ksl.dev.java.net is about is trying to\nprovide a scientific basis for the debate. Throw stuff into the\nkitchen sink without thinking too hard about whether or not its a\ngood idea. Let folks kick the tires. Those experiences then inform\nthe choice of which features go into the standard.\n",
