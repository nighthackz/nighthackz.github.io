  "body" : "I met up with more of the Brazilian group today. As always, they're\nway out there. They're easy to recognize: several of them wear\nflags as capes. And they're loud. The whole country is a party. But\nlots of interesting technology and great hackers. A group of them\ngot an award this year for their tax collection system: 96% of all\ntax returns are filed electronically, The back end is all J2EE, and\nthey have a new J2SE front end. I wish taxes were as easy in this\ncountry.\n",
