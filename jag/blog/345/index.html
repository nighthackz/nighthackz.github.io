<img align=right src='01opedimg-articleInline.jpg'>WIlliam Gibson wrote a great op-ed piece for <a href=
"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/01/opinion/01gibson.html">The New
York Times</a>. It's all about the universe that's being built
around us by Google (and Facebook, and many of the other social
media sites). Despite their good intentions and 'do no evil'
mantra, they're getting perilously close to some of the dystopian
nightmares that should stay in the pages of fiction. With every
line of code we engineers write, we have to ask ourselves: does
this move us closer to the world of Star Trek, or of Blade Runner?
I, for one, would rather not live in the Blade Runner universe, and
yet that's what we're sliding into building. 

<p>One small act that can help avoid the dystopia is to <a href=
"http://www.cafepress.com/OrcOmit">keep the pressure on Oracle to
do the right thing</a>. I don't believe that parading around in
protest t-shirts will convince them to do what <a href=
"http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/summaries/2007/December07-summary.html">they
committed to</a>, but it'll let them know that the community is
watching.</p>

<p>I have an offer to members of the press: a free dinner anywhere
in the Bay Area to anyone who gets a straight, reasonable,
intellectually defensible official answer from Oracle to the
question of why their demand for the creation of an independent
Java Foundation applied to Sun, but now doesn't apply to
Oracle.</p>
