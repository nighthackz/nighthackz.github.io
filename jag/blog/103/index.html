All of Sun Labs went to the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk today to
ride rollercoasters, play arcade games, and generally have a good
time. It reminded me of one of my favorite metaphors for the
process of design: it's a game that appears often in these game
arcades in different forms and with different names. The one at the
Boardwalk is called Whack-a-Mole. There's a square box with a grid
of large holes on the top. Usually three holes by three holes.
There's a mechanism to cause something (in this case, a fake fur
Mole) to pop out of one of the holes. You play the game by taking a
bat and trying to whack (hit) the mole on the head. But the mole
always pops back down into his hole and pops up somewhere else. So
you take the bat and try to whack the mole on the head in it's new
place. But of course, he pops back into the box and pops up
somewhere else. No matter what you do, the mole always pops up
somewhere else. You win if you can get the mole to stay in the box
and not pop up. Damn near impossible.

<p>Design is like that. Designs always have problems. So you go
work on that problem. But often what you do to solve that problem
causes new problems to pop up somewhere else. All too often people
will come to me and say "I've solved the problem". I'll look at it
and essentially say "yes, but no: what you've really done is
<i>moved</i> the problem. Design is about compromise. You rarely
get to eliminate all problems: you just get to decide which
problems you're willing to work with.</p>

<p>One place where this shows up as a real point of friction is
with folks fresh out of school. Throughout shool you mostly work on
problems concocted by instructors for some didactic purpose. They
have a solution in mind. You know that the solution exists. The
problem is usually constructed so that the solution is clean (this
most often shows up in high shool mathematics). But the real world
isn't that way. Problems are messy. There often isn't a perfect
solution that solves all the problems. Major frustration and
disillusion ensues.</p>

<p>Get over it.  <i>Seek Balance</i></p>
